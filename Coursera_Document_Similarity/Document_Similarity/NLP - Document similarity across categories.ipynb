       " 'the first story in sara majka’s first book begins, “maybe 10 or 11 years ago, when i was in the middle of a divorce from a man i still loved, i took the train into the city.” there the narrator visits an art exhibit — the story is called “reverón’s dolls,” after the venezuelan artist — and stays in an apartment owned by an artist friend, filled with light and canvases. unjustly, i assumed right away that i knew exactly what kind of book this would be: a book about arty people with complicated personal lives, who use the word “lover” and contemplate wintry landscapes from lonely trains.there are arty people and wintry landscapes in “cities i’ve never lived in.” the narrator above, who is common to many of the 14 stories, does use the word “lover,” and reflects on relationships that seem exceedingly complicated. but \\xadmajka brings the reader to startling places. the stories feature an array of discomfiting situations and hardscrabble new england lives. all of the stories are sad. a father leaves his daughter with a neighbor and rents an apartment in another town; a mother meets up with the ex-husband who killed their daughter while driving drunk. a little girl is abducted from a church day care and \\xadnever seen again. many of them are spooky. a young man leaves a mental hospital and finds that his island home has disappeared from the map. there are doppelgängers throughout the stories — in a bookstore and on the street and in a painting hidden in an attic. watching an old museum security tape, the narrator catches a glimpse of herself as a child.majka is dexterous at bringing a physical clarity to the sites of emotional muddle; the boy in the mental hospital had “cut his wrists with his father’s coping saw, and lay on the ground watching the sawdust turn red until someone opened the door.” she excels at writing \\xadneglected, forlorn people and places. a foyer in a \\xaddingy apartment features an end table piled with old mail, mail that is “parchmenty and bowed in the middle.” the mother of the dead girl is one of a class of women “who have no femininity in them, but also nothing hard, it was just that life had brought them to having no extra gestures.” (alice munro is name-checked by the narrator, and her influence is perceptible throughout, although no one can achieve her particular brand of crispness.)in the titular story, majka’s main narrator conceives a plan to travel to soup kitchens around the country, talking to the poor. in one city she sees an exhibit about homeless people; she is moved by their stories but tells her mother on the phone that “it was too compassionate” to be effective. real artists, she explains, take from people “for their own ends.” this is actually a useful annotation to \\xadmajka’s work. “cities i’ve never lived in” is not a compassionate book, exactly, despite all the sad things in it. from certain angles, it’s a kind of new england gothic, where the lost children and dead women and doppelgängers serve to add atmosphere and meaning to the narrator’s past peregrinations, her dalliances and uncertainties. it turns out in the end that this is in fact a book about an arty person with a complicated personal life. but it’s a lovely one, written in a moving and uncanny register.',\n",

       " 'donald passman is a magician. literally.like passman himself, those sentences may have deeper meaning than they first suggest. read one way, they say that he practices the art of magic in the traditional theatrical sense, onstage — which he does. read another way, and allowing for a joycean turn of phrase, they suggest that passman has literary skills worthy of a magician. that is true — passman is a successful mystery novelist, including the recent the amazing harvey, which features both a magician and a lawyer and a little-known scientific fact about dna. read yet another way, they could refer to passman’s status as one of the world’s leading entertainment lawyers, specializing in the music industry, adept at the “tricks of the trade.”and finally, yet another meaning is possible, for a search for books by donald s. passman on amazon reveals a doppelganger, a professor in wisconsin who has published multiple tomes on the arcane, magical subject of advanced mathematical theory, with suspiciously magical titles such as the algebraic structure of group rings, permutation groups, and infinite crossed products. a mere coincidence? or an epic illusion? a magician never reveals his tricks.passman’s book all you need to know about the music business, an iconic work first published in 1991 and now in its ninth edition, reveals yet another persona (thank you ingmar bergman, whose movies also include the magician). this side of passman is the expert, albeit one who writes for his audience: aspiring musicians, the kind of dreamers he has seen conquer the music industry for years, often as his clients. he likes to address his readers directly with disarming phrases such as “well, kiddies,” or “well, my friend,” and invitations to the reader that encapsulate the combination of law and magic that is passman’s unique brand: “so step right up. all these secrets and more are revealed just inside the tent.”ever-conscious of the reader’s expectations, and well aware that his self-described prime audience of aspiring rockers may not have a scholarly bent, passman offers the reader shortcuts, suggests what to skip, and provides disclaimers noting that the book offers an overview but not every possible angle. the way passman writes these disclaimers serves as an enjoyable literary exercise, almost hidden between the pages of the book, while offering brief glimpses of a world of hidden tricks “behind the curtain”:there is no way one book (even one filling several volumes) could poke into every nook and cranny of a business as complicated as the music business. so the purpose here is to give you the big picture, not all the details. (besides, for some of those details, i charge serious money).as part of this congenial approach, the writing makes use of intriguing metaphors where passman the “explainer” briefly steps aside for passman the gifted writer, as in this passage:so the goal is to give you a broad overview (which doesn’t change nearly as quickly). that way you’ll have a bare tree on which to hang the leaves of your own experience. oddly, it’s easier to pick up details (from trade publications, gossip at cocktail parties, etc.) than it is to learn the structural overview, because few people have the time or patience to sit down and give it to you. in fact, giving you the overall view turned out to be a much bigger job than i thought when i started. but you’re worth it.passman’s writing deftly moves between poetic metaphor, practical advice, self-confessional, and personal support, a combination that no doubt helped him through years of dealing with highly creative and highly insecure creative artists.passman’s gradually unfolding story of the music industry is like a world-class educational museum, populated by intricate scientific exhibits and beautiful sculptures. while strolling from the beginning to the end, our guide explains the monuments succinctly, with style and humor, short personal anecdotes, on-point cultural references, and great historical insight and knowledge. to our delight, and astonishment, by the end of the tour we have deep expertise, acquired effortlessly and enjoyably.the museum metaphor is appropriate, since much of the complexity of the music industry can only be understood by an examination of its history, its roots. those roots include copyright law and the way contracts have evolved in the music world. custom and practice in music industry contracts is a devilish and arcane area where decades of one-upmanship, subtle advantage, out-of-date accommodations (10 percent deduction for broken discs?), and “gotchas” have, unfortunately, sometimes become “industry standard,” which can often be puzzling to newcomers.passman’s book is noted for its superb detail, lavishing pages (and some engaging cartoon illustrations) on terms like “cross-collateralization,” presented as an unavoidable evil you need to understand, and at least try to avoid in negotiations. without the occasional use of candid reactions such as “you won’t believe this but it’s true, no kidding kiddies,” some music industry contractual terms would, in fact, be hard to believe — passman’s style helps him break the bad news to his readers gently and with humor. throughout the book, we approach details only after learning the fundamental structure. trees and leaves.when writers turn their attention to an entire industry, there are many choices to be made regarding structure, content, presentation, and organization. passman’s journey through the industry is organized in a logical sequence for any aspiring rock star, beginning with the team of advisors employed by successful artists (agent, manager, lawyer, business manager, publicist), recording agreements, publishing agreements, group issues (a band is a partnership that requires agreements), touring, merchandising, and film music. the perspective is that of an “ultimate” success story, a high-level international artist, for whom all of these areas come into play, but it provides helpful context even if, realistically, most artists and lawyers will be dealing with only parts of this landscape.especially enjoyable are the nonstop cultural references. in a passage about traditional record sales (a business quickly being superseded by streaming, as the book notes), we get classic passman when he describes an oppressive world that sometimes seems to go about things in its own illogical way: “so how does all this affect your royalties? to paraphrase george orwell in animal farm, some record sales are more equal than others.” and again when he offers a realistic, even fatalistic assessment of deals that must, for better or for worse, give in to and accommodate greed: “in that case, you might allow the subpublisher to get as much as 50%, on the theory that your 50% is better than zero or a machete.”virtually every page has “dry humor,” mild sarcasm, knowing irony, and pop culture references — “when we get to single-song sheet music, we really enter the twilight zone” — which helps explain why the book has been so successful over the years and is in its ninth edition (updated with “new business models” such as online streaming). it creates a safe fairy tale (or more accurately “fractured fairy tale”) atmosphere for learning challenging and detailed content that might otherwise appear to be for lawyers only.there are other wonderful books about the music industry (music, money, and success by jeffrey and todd brabec comes to mind), and in the world of independent film law, a similar informal writing style is used with great success by michael donaldson and lisa callif in clearance and copyright (which i reviewed for larb last year). but in the world of the music industry, passman’s writing style and approach is unique because it presents so much depth of content and detail in such an engaging way. for that reason, it has become an industry classic, read not only by musicians but by executives and lawyers as well, educating a generation.and that, kiddies, is real magic.¤corey field is of counsel in the los angeles office of national law firm ballard spahr llp, where he practices copyright, trademark, and entertainment law.',\n",

       " 'from a late nineteenth-century french advertisement.the french are known for how they wear scarves. that’s such a cliché that it hardly merits repeating. but like so many clichés, it’s rooted in truth. and today i was reminded of that.i was at a clothing store in paris. while i sat on a low bench and waited for a friend to emerge from the dressing room, i watched women of all ages try on scarves and wraps in front of a nearby mirror. each woman tried on her scarf differently; some draped, some wrapped, some poufed the lengths of fabric into tall, proud collars. several tried more than one effect, seeing how the cloth behaved. but one thing they all had in common.each tried on not just a scarf but a range of attitudes. haughty, casual, elegant. her posture would change along with her expression; her look would not be merely appraising but far seeing. here she would be at this party, in that weather. with a range of shirts and jackets, armor for the different battles of life.for the first time i realized what people mean when they say they “hate to shop.” it’s not just a question of harsh lighting or unflattering mirrors or money or consumerism; rather, it’s the work of imagination that’s required. who am i? you have to ask yourself. who would i like to be? and how do the two vary? that, of course, is the hardest part. it’s where notions are put to the test; the only question is how honest you’ll be with yourself.the converse is true, too, of course. in those moments at the mirror, all things are possible—at least, the moments before you put it on, or take it off, or look at the price tag. cashmere feels just as soft to the hand that can’t afford it.\\xa0one of the women—who’d had, moments before, the air of someone walking into a lavish party—saw me staring at her in the corner of the mirror. i expected a sharp reproach, but her look was merely disapproving. these things, after all, are highly personal.sadie stein is contributing editor of the paris review, and the daily’s correspondent.\\xa0',\n",

       " 'broken started the way a lot of these things do: with a post on livejournal.a long time ago i got involved in a comment thread about superhero names, and i came up with a few that i liked: broken, sky ranger, and crimson cadet. from that, the germ of a story began to grow. how could i not want to write about super-powered people with these names?and so i did. i entered nanowrimo that year and managed to produce a very rough draft of broken.i love superheroes, and i always have. i grew up watching the old batman tv show and superfriends; later i devoured the batman animated series, superman, justice league, and the 1990s cartoon version of x-men. superheroes are a mess of questions, most of the time. why did they take separate “hero” names, and where did those come from? how did they deal with feeling different? how do they relate to one another?superhero teams are something that especially fascinated me. how do all these incredibly powerful people get along? what could possibly bring them together? how might they break apart?broken’s extrahuman union is a deliberate echo of these old superhero teams. it’s sort of like a mandatory version of xavier’s school for gifted youngsters that no one can ever leave!much as i loved traditional superhero stories like batman and peter david’s run on the supergirl comic book, i started to seek out alternative ways of looking at them. the authority, the dark knight returns, watchmen, and the maxx are comics that looked at superheroes through a darker, stranger lens.and so broken herself is descended from supergirl, jenny sparks, the maxx, and even alita from the manga battle angel alita.the rest of the world of broken owes a lot to 90s science fiction tv like babylon 5 and to all the fantastic space opera i’ve read, like lois mcmaster bujold’s miles vorkosigan saga.the book also owes a debt to george w. bush. if he hadn’t beaten john kerry in 2004, i wouldn’t have been grouchy enough to spend an entire month writing about super-powered people living under an emergent fascist regime. thanks, george!but maybe the biggest and weirdest influence on the book is a line from the butthole surfers song “pepper,” which is all about teens who go courting death. it goes “some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountain / that is pouring like an avalanche, coming down the mountain.”this story—this whole series—is about broken falling in love with life.',\n",

wasn’t my fault that the world was full of men like the one who let me steal sunglasses from the mini-mart because i let him leer at me wiggling down the aisle. it wasn’t my fault men went fish-faced at the sight of me.i knew my desire felt like drowning in thick honey, and i knew how to let the slick of my want slide onto the tops of my thighs. i knew what it felt like to be wanted. to see a grown man on his knees, telling me i was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. and better: to believe him.*this story. the one i’m about to tell you? some of it is a lie.when i was thirteen, my mom’s friend, debbie, came to visit. debbie was my mom’s single friend—she had never married, and she was the stuff of legend. she owned a boutique, went to fashion conventions, and drove a red firebird with a t-top. debbie was the essence of single womanhood—confident, with her own money, and a lot of sass.i noticed right away that debbie’s hair looked different. much longer than i remembered, and gorgeously permed, these cascading blonde curls hanging down around her mid-back. looking at it, for the first time, i realized that there was hair, and then there was hair.imagine how delighted i was when debbie unclipped the long, sexy hair from behind her bangs. she was still beautiful, just less than “mtv video queen beautiful.” the dirty blonde, shoulder length hair i remembered appeared.“it’s a fall,” she said. “i got it at one of my conventions, and let me tell you, when i want to be noticed, it’s a godsend. i nicknamed it dobbie—that’s my alternate personality when i wear it. you can’t imagine how quickly men offer to pump my gas when i pull in as dobbie. when i go out as dobbie, all my drinks are free.”dobbie was a superwoman. powerful. bringing men to heel.i coveted her more and more as the minutes passed, as i stroked the curls of dobbie, and wanted her for my very own. she seemed magical to my thirteen-year-old heart, which was already weary of being ignored. i thought if i had dobbie, the boys i liked would fall to their knees instead of barely looking at me while they asked me if i thought my best friend, paige, would want to go out with them.“try it on,” debbie interrupted. “your hair is close enough—i think it will match.”i eyed her in disbelief before assenting. me? really?debbie clipped the fall into my hair, about halfway back, near the crown of my head. the curls cascaded over my shoulders and down my back. i have never had hair this long, and never so thick, so curly, so… grown up. i ran to the bathroom to check myself out in the mirror. dobbie hid my awkward hairline pimples and overshadowed my dorky, long denim shorts. i was a dreamgirl version of myself.i fluffed dobbie and strutted provocatively around the bathroom. i bent from the waist and watched the hair swing down and all around my body. i watched my body move, my neck seemed longer. i looked older, powerful, bordering on womanly.i ran out to the living room, and asked if i could go show paige.my mother barely looked up from chatting with debbie and waved me off.i strutted through the neighborhood. near the main road, i stopped to tie a shoelace. as i was crouched over, a car whizzed by, and out of the window flew my first wolf whistle.i blushed, and then i straightened into it. like being hit, but deciding to embrace the sting instead of fight.i felt visible. watched. noticed. it was as though the long march of prepuberty had ended, and finally there was something worth liking about me. and sure, i told myself, it was probably the hair. and sure, i knew that it wasn’t even my real hair. but still.this was how i realized that i wanted, more than anything else, to be desired.before this, i always blended in. sure, once you got to know me, i was interesting. i could hold a conversation with an adult. i was charming even. witty. but that took more than a passing glance to know.what i wanted now, what i realized was the most important thing, was to be recognizably special. i wanted to be hot. sexy. wanted.and this was how i came to understand my power. my body was a sword. my mirror was the whetting stone.*i first encountered lolita, nabokov’s nymphet, when i was twelve\\xa0years old. adrian lyne was remaking the classic film, and held an open casting call in san francisco for a new lolita. to prepare, i watched kubrick’s film on the couch with my mother, eyes glued to the screen, insides molten with the dawning realization that there were other girls like me. i thought i was alone.lolita in the book was twelve\\xa0years old, like me, but in the film they made her fourteen\\xa0to make viewers more comfortable. like me, lolita was a victim of a desire she didn’t understand. until i was thirty\\xa0years old, i thought lolita was a heroine. i also thought that girls like lolita and me were rare.sable was thirteen\\xa0when she had sex with iggy pop. lori was fourteen\\xa0when she was kidnapped by jimmy page’s tour manager and delivered to his hotel room. but she was thirteen\\xa0when she lost her virginity to david bowie. bill wyman of the rolling stones started dating mandy at thirteen, but waited until she was fourteen\\xa0to have sex with her. jerry lee lewis and edgar allen poe married their thirteen-year-old cousins, myra and virginia, respectively.priscilla was fourteen\\xa0when she met elvis presley; she married him seven years later. she was forged by a man during the exact period of time when she should have been forming her sense of self. “i was someone he created,” she said. “i was just a kid and i was consumed by him. all i desired was not to disappoint him.”*when i tell you that my life’s ambition was to be a famous actress, i want you to understand. i don’t mean that it was a hobby. i mean that from the age of five, when i first stepped into a yellow spotlight on the apron of a high school auditorium, until the age of nineteen, when i stepped onto a plane and left nyu, my singular obsession was to transform myself into the kind of great actress that makes history.when i tell you about him, i want you to understand. he wasn’t just my teacher. he was the rockstar teacher of our theater program. he taught shakespeare—the hardest, and most lauded subject. he went to juilliard—the impossible, and most lauded school. he was born in trinidad, and the traces of his accent under his juilliard-perfect diction were exotic to a bunch of high schoolers, many of whom felt he was the greatest thing to ever happen to our school.he was handsome and funny and accessible. add to that his immense talent as a performer, and his genuine skill as a teacher. add to that his personal charisma. his voice had a natural vibration, like a timpani drum, and it thrummed across our bodies when he spoke. add to that he was a flirty person, really. with all of us, men and women, he had that sparkly look in his eye that said he knew what the rules were, and might sometimes break them. he was engaging. he cared what we thought. he made time for us before and after class, to tutor us and coach us.when he asked me to babysit his three-year-old for him and his wife, i felt like i should be paying him.when he kissed me, finally, after nearly a year of me pining for him to do it, i want you to understand how it felt. not just the kiss part, which was magically soft and aggressive—a grown man’s kiss. i want you to understand that it also felt like i had won something. not just his affection, his desire, his gaze. i had won the grand prize that all of my friends were after: the gorgeous, smart, talented, funny, and totally admired teacher.i was on top of the world.if this was victimization, my body had no idea. i was overflowing want and desire, i melted into his touch, my breath came fast, when it came at all. i lifted myself toward him, pressed closer, begged with all of my body language. if this was being exploited, if this was wrong? it didn’t feel bad. and i didn’t want to hear otherwise for a very long time.there were moments, of course, when i felt a suspicion that i was actually overwhelmed. the same body that told me what felt good gave me indications that something was wrong. idiot lights, but i ignored them. my feelings were too large, too foggy. i could barely breathe with him, let alone get my bearings. it was years before i knew how to say no, i’ve had enough. it was in my thirties that i discovered that i could handle the anxiety of rejecting a man, and that i was free to prioritize my comfort in my own body over making a man happy. at sixteen, i didn’t recognize a clear thought: that this was maybe a kiss too far, a squeeze too much, a mouthful of something that i didn’t really want to swallow, but didn’t know how to spit out. i didn’t know how to protect myself if that meant disappointing men.what if i hurt his feelings?i never worried about hurting myself. to suffer for my beauty felt like the natural order of things.there were moments when i left my body to be with him, and my head floated near the ceiling. at the time, i thought those were indicators of my intense love and desire. i thought this was normal. it took me twelve years and a lot of digging into my guts with a therapist to understand that these moments were, in fact, markers of a trauma that i didn’t believe had occurred.*when i first started writing about myself as a teenage girl, i could only write in second person. you. as though she were so completely separated from me, she was a different person. you wanted it. you thought you were mature. you went over to his house of your own free will, and laid yourself on the floor in front of him. you were wet. you said yes. you had agency and desire. you were the one with the leverage. he lost everything, and you had nothing to lose.just recently, i began to see what i lost. it wasn’t a job, a wife, a house. there was no tangible evidence of my fall, no record of my mistakes to be expunged. there was only the wreckage of my early adulthood, the loss of my unstoppable nature, and the empty hole where once my confidence grew. there was only a string of decisions to run and run again, to hide from ambition, to leave the theater forever, and to disown my dedication as a childish fantasy. and the reinforcement of my suspicion that i was only visible when i was wanted, and that nothing about me would ever eclipse my objecthood.he lost his job; i lost everything but.*when the whole world spins at his tempo, and he only has eyes for you, his gaze feels like power with an aftertaste of wonder. wonderful. wonderfalling.lolita lifts her mouth to his. does she desire? in his fiction, she dares herself desire. everything about her is filtered through humbert’s narration; we only know what he will allow us to know, and what he sees is want. her want is tidal, all of her spent crashing against the beach of him.what might have been her slow self-discovery, he takes as his opportunity.and what does he do? with great power comes great responsibility. did he forget? who was the first man to permit himself this? before humbert, before jagger, before bowie, even before poe. how far back does this permission go?he is supposed to say no.why doesn’t he say no?*debbie drove a red firebird with a t-top. i loved that car and the way it looked both feminine and powerful with her behind the wheel. i stared out the window and watched debbie as she pulled in and out of the driveway, craning my neck to see her disappear down the street.one day when i was still thirteen, while debbie and my mom were smoking pot on the deck, i snuck into the house and took debbie’s keys from her purse. i knew how to start a car. i thought i could handle the steering part.i hadn’t anticipated the manual transmission.i sat in the firebird, in the driveway, keys poised in hand, for a long time. the heat got oppressive, the air turned thick. i put the key in the ignition and i flicked it to accessory. i wanted to press my foot down against the pedals and zoom off.i sat in the car and stared at the gear shaft.i wouldn’t admit it, but i was afraid.that night i had a dream that i had started the firebird and driven off alone.i couldn’t see well, i noticed that right away. the night was too dark, and the headlights were dim gold holes in an otherwise overwhelming blackness. the windshield was there, but it wasn’t a portal to the road ahead, the way i was anticipating. the road was unlit. a small town, neighborhood road. it wasn’t even paved that well, let alone marked by streetlamps. there was only one streetlamp on my street, way down at the corner. i used to run into its little golden puddle of safety when i walked home in the dark, and got spooked by the witches i imagined in the shadows. in my dream, even my streetlamp showed me nothing of the road.i could steer, but only with my instincts. if i thought about it too much, if i tried to concentrate on the words like left and right, the wheel rattled under my hands and the car seemed to buckle. if i relaxed and simply shifted my weight, the car did better. it was responsive, like it was made to hold me. like it was mine. when i wanted to go faster, it flew beneath my body like we were one thing. girl and machine. a fembot of my own imagination.i felt the horrible lurching bump at the same moment that i heard the sound. banging. i had hit something. it was big. bad. my heart started racing. i couldn’t get my dreambrain around what had happened; i hadn’t seen anything coming.in the rearview mirror, everything was lit up, as though behind me were a million streetlamps, all of them glowing their cold, purple light onto the macadam. i could see, clear as day, what i’d hit, and i felt the sickness rise up in my body. my stomach twisted. on the road. not dead, but rising. it was the unmistakeable body of a man.***rumpus original art by jyotsna

       " '“if you were crazy,” a supercomputer on the verge of sentience asks a young girl who’s pretty sure that she’s a witch, “how would you know you were crazy?” she has no conclusive answer. like so much else in charlie jane anders’s all the birds in the sky, the question of sanity is relative, not absolute.all the birds in the sky is a genre-crossing sci-fi, fantasy, literary romance that pulses with energy. anders seamlessly combines the futuristic vision of william gibson with a fantastic, terry pratchett–like playfulness. the book presents a richly imagined magical world, an empathetic understanding of what it feels like to grow up an outsider, and a loving vision of a pre-apocalyptic near-future in san francisco, the city where anders lives and works. this book is being billed as her “debut novel for adults,” although she’s written one ya novel, lots of shorter fiction (over 100 stories, according to her official bio), and countless blog entries and essays as the founder and editor of io9, the sci-fi arm of gawker media.patricia, a witch, and laurence, a mad scientist, are children at the novel’s outset, and are just beginning to explore their capabilities. both are social outcasts with uncomfortable relationships with their families. their friendship begins as a transaction meant to keep laurence from having to return to wilderness camp, but they quickly become each other’s only allies. anders writes about the indignities of adolescence with gentle, empathetic humor. “at last he understood what all those old horror stories meant when they talked about an eldritch dread, creeping into your very soul. that was how laurence felt, listening to his mother attempt to talk to him about girls.”it’s not just the stifling mortification of talking about dating with a parent: the push for conformity in the children’s community is oppressive to everyone in it. the most popular boy in school has body image issues; an assassin serving as a guidance counselor (a favorite of the student body at large) is numbed by the mindlessness of the american educational system. patricia in particular is subjected to a campaign that’s carrie-like in its cruelty. it’s made worse by the fact that it’s undertaken by a gaslighting authority figure, who ultimately drives both children from their homes in attempt to prevent his hallucinatory but perhaps prophetic vision that one day they will bring about the end of the world.we catch up with laurence and patricia again later, as grown-ups, in san francisco. the harry potter years are only visited through flashback. in the meantime, patricia has gone to magic school, while laurence went to mit. he’s become the golden boy figurehead employee for a visionary tech entrepreneur, and patricia is doing secret witchy things around the city (and maintaining multiple day jobs to pay rent). anders keeps the focus on the solipsistic sf tech scene, but even the tech bubble isn’t impervious to signs that the world outside is changing. the large-scale disasters, both natural and manmade, that are happening with increasing frequency across the rest of the world may not have reached the west coast yet, but their effects are impossible to avoid. a lame party is made even more of a bummer by the fact that “everybody felt guilty about drinking soju after what happened in korea.” the party must go on, though, even if the dubthrash dj was making “everybody’s eardrums bleed with the most dreary shit imaginable,” and thank god it does, because this is where patricia and laurence meet again.the tech world and the magic world are set up as opposing ideological forces, with institutional goals that will inevitably butt up against each other. both factions are powerful and well intentioned; both have plans that are myopic and could have devastating consequences. narratively, both forces function the same way. the magical mechanism that allows one character to turn into a bird is explained no more clearly than the scientific process that allows another character to build a two-second time machine. the explanation isn’t necessary, though. what’s more important is how patricia and laurence use their respective powers, and the questions such uses raise. are ethics universal or situational? what if you’re sure you’re right, but someone else is too?as patricia and laurence’s orbits begin to intersect more and more frequently, and the world gets closer and closer to the brink of destruction, it becomes clear that there could be some truth to the horrible destiny foreseen by that long-ago assassin. which means that they have to face even tougher questions. when it comes to saving the world, what’s worth sacrificing, and what’s worth saving? how do you even know if it’s actually the end of the world? as one character asks, “what if we’re only eighty percent sure it’s the apocalypse?” there are no easy answers; in fact there may be no answers at all.no single big bad exists in all the birds in the sky, no clear force of evil that must be defeated. even the worst characters are well intentioned, if destructive, and the best solutions tend to wreak at least as much havoc as the problems they are intended to solve. this refusal of easy fixes is one of the book’s greatest strengths. in showing humans as both incredibly powerful and incredibly inconsequential, it assumes the best of its readers, and the best of its characters. humans do very bad things, to be sure, with great regularity, but there is no single individual who can change the course of history. “history is a tidal wave,” another character says. “you can’t swim against a tidal wave.” in the book, as in life, the metaphor may or may not be accurate.in an interview with wired, anders shared a few of her major literary and cultural influences (from piers plowman to doris lessing), but myriad others season the book — through both explicit allusions and subtler cues too numerous to count. pop culture references pepper the text. at one point, one of the protagonists deflects a question with the quick answer: “dimensional transcendentalism,” to which the frustrated questioner responds, “you just stole that from doctor who. this is not a joke, this is serious.” in one brief passage, a self-fashioned superhero (although she does not call herself that) intervenes in the life of a poet who seems straight out of the pages of armistead maupin; in another she intervenes in an assault reminiscent of a lidia yuknavitch essay. fairy tale tropes are turned on their heads to wonderful effect. the characters doing the saving and the sacrificing aren’t whom you’d expect, and they’re not sacrificing what you’d think. gender roles are inverted; magic interventions shape science in ways that can’t be explained; birds meet and tweet endlessly to each other about parliamentary points and arcane inquiries.every review i’ve read has identified different influences, from daniel pinkwater to lev grossman to dave eggers and beyond. they’re all correct, which is not to say the book’s derivative, because it’s not. anders makes the old brand new again, synthesizing something lovely and urgent from all of these disparate sources. familiar elements form the foundation of the story, but the way that they’re used yields the most joyful apocalypse novel i’ve ever had the pleasure of reading. the world of all the birds in the sky is as rich and wonderful as it is cruel, and even as situations spiral out of the characters’ control, there’s a fundamental optimism about humanity at the heart of the book.as the questions of apocalypse become too urgent to ignore, patricia and laurence must find answers, not necessarily the right answers, but answers. it’s an impossible, divisive task. anders writes gorgeous, exciting prose, and the moral and narrative complexity she’s set up in all the birds in the sky carries all the way through its ambitious, heartbreaking, hopeful ending. this book has been tremendously well received, and will most likely earn itself a place on the shelf among all its venerable influencers as a new addition to the canon. i don’t want to overhype anything; it’s probably due for a takedown, just to compensate for all the buzz. that won’t come from me, though.¤kate burns is a writer who lives in los angeles.',\n",

       " 'weldon is proudly a nerd. it’s clear that he’s always been one, and while he functions in the world of “normals” (his word), he’s not a part of it. (i am a geek, but i straddle the worlds of nerdery and normalcy, and find myself often translating between the two and getting constantly frustrated with both.) when you listen to him on pchh, he has a quality to his voice that marks him as a nerd – over-enunciated “r”s, for one thing. \\xa0i’m not saying anything that he hasn’t said himself, and\\xa0there’s a vocal quality that marks our people. i can hear the cadence from half a block away.so when he’s talking about the rise of nerd culture, he knows what he’s talking about, from a dude nerd perspective. when the concept of batman moved from the comic book shop to television in the 60s, there was an uprising of rage among the comic book fans of the time that the show in all of it’s candy-colored, ridiculous, pop-art glory wasn’t the “real” batman, and suddenly all these people who hadn’t put in their time appreciating the “pure” batman of the comic felt like they knew batman.nerds disagreed.and this thing of “batman is accessible to the people,” much to the dismay and distress of “pure” batman fans everywhere, has played out over and over again, and weldon traces that, along with the effect the rise of the internet had on that culture. suddenly instead of gathering in groups at comic book stores or writing into fan magazines, they could gather\\xa0in large virtual groups online without even putting on pants (full disclosure: i’m writing this review in my pjs. fuck pants).when large groups can suddenly shift the narrative from “yay we’re getting a batman movie!” (1989…..kind of….) to “joel schumacher is a fake nerd who doesn’t know shit about batman and batman and robin is gonna suck!” that shift has a distinct effect on how pop culture even functions.',\n",

       " 'weldon’s thesis isn’t that “batman created nerd culture as we know it” but “here’s a case study of how this societal shift happened in this particular subculture.” what’s really interesting to me is how hollywood has learned to manage the nerd-rage game. joel schumacher was seen as an outsider, while christopher nolan managed to position himself as “one of us.” what that did is made the batman nerds protective of the nolan movies – to the point of making death threats to critics who give the movies bad reviews.weldon also touches on the ways that men and women tend to engage when\\xa0they celebrate their nerdery. men tend towards curation: collecting things and exacting replicas.\\xa0women tend towards creation: fanfic and \\xa0cosplay. there’s always been tension between these two approaches, and weldon sums it up thusly:nerd culture is often open and inclusive, when it is powered by the desire to seek out others who share common interests and enthusiasms. \\xa0but nerdish passion is strong and unmindful; its very nature is to obliterate dispassion, nuance, ambiguity, and push human experience to the other edge of a binary extreme: my thing is the best. your thing is the worst.moreover, if you do not love my thing in the same way, to the same degree, and for exactly the same reasons that i do, you are doing it wrong.that’s pretty much the crux of it.as a history of batman, this is pretty good. as a discussion of how nerd culture weaved its way in and amongst the batcycles, this is fascinating. weldon knows what he’s talking about, and he knows it because he’s lived the past 40 years as a nerd. he was there on the inside, but he’s smart enough and has enough self-awareness to be able to see the bigger picture.i’m still pondering what implications this has for romancelandia.this book is available from:march 22, 2016',\n",

       " \"the whiting began offering its seminars three years ago. “i suddenly had awful visions of our writers being on the hook for taxes at the end of a year that was supposed to offer them freedom,” said courtney hodell, the foundation’s director of writers’ programs. “the idea was to set up a space where creative people could ask questions of a professional who understands how writers live and work, talk frankly with one another about their issues and experiences around money, and generally neutralize the taboo that can keep people from making informed decisions.”around the table, conversation was open, candid — part useful instruction, part pep talk, part encounter group. the writers spoke of confusion and angst surrounding many of the topics ms. smith covered, including student loans, mortgages, retirement, credit cards, poorly paying adjunct professorships and the dreaded i.r.s. schedule c that self-employed people have to fill out.“when i was a poet living under the stairs in brooklyn, i tried to be self-employed on my taxes,” mr. blanchfield said. (like harry potter’s room at the dursleys’ house, his studio apartment was, in fact, under the stairs.) one year, he said, he made something like $250 from his poetry but reported $4,500 in writing-related expenses, triggering a warning letter from the i.r.s. about a possible audit. “it made me really scared,” he said. (“there are a lot of ways to show that you are a legitimate professional writer,” ms. smith counseled. “don’t let fear prevent you from deducting for expenses.”)after the session, several of the writers elaborated on their situations.“there’s a temptation to use magical money for magical purposes, to say, i should just throw the money up in the air and quit my job for a year and write my book,” said alice sola kim, 32, who supports herself in part from her job as the executive assistant to a columbia professor, writes short fiction and nonfiction for a variety of publications and is working on a novel. “but this has taught me there’s another way, too, that i can be prudent about the future.”like many of the writers, ms. kim said she had a conflicted attitude toward money. she grew up without much in seattle — her mother was frugal, but her father was profligate.“it can feel like this stuff just doesn’t apply to people who grow up poor or have been poor or don’t have a sense of money,” she said. “when you get money, you either hoard it like a dragon because you feel it’s not really real, or you spend it because you need to spend it. it doesn’t feel relevant to be thinking about things like roth iras.”mitchell s. jackson, 40 and the author of a novel and a book of essays and short stories, said that until recently he supported himself largely through teaching. at one time, he taught something like eight classes, paying between $1,800 and $5,500 each, at different colleges. he made a lot less than he had when he worked at his first job, dealing crack and other drugs as a teenager in portland, ore.“i don’t think i ever got it out of my mind how a drug dealer spends money,” he said, “which is really frivolous. it comes fast, and you spend it just as fast, and that’s set the tone. i know it’s not an entirely intelligent way to deal with my finances.”in the seminar, ms. smith admonished the group members to refuse to work for nothing and to demand to be paid what their time and writing are worth.“never say, ‘i usually get x, but … ’” she advised. “that means you’ve gone in apologizing. always say, ‘my rate is y, what i need to charge is y.’ just so it’s simple and clear, like when a plumber comes to your house to fix your sink.”mr. blanchfield, whose latest work, a book of essays, comes out this week, said he had been particularly inspired by this concept.“it was like a great therapy session, in that she was saying that the right answer to anyone who wants you to work for less than you can live on, or do work that does not have a measurable gain for your writing career, is no,” he said. “the right answer is no! i thought that was pretty great.”a version of this article appears in print on april 7, 2016, on page c1 of the new york edition with the headline: helping writers with a windfall avoid a downfall.  order reprints| today's paper|subscribe\",\n",

       " 'the ultimate responsibility for the united states’ actions lies with an “oblivious” american public engrossed in “shallow digital enthusiasms and the worship of celebrity,” bacevich writes. americans support freedom, democracy and prosperity in other nations, he tells us, as long as they get the lion’s share of it. “ensuring that americans enjoy their rightful quota (which is to say, more than their fair share) of freedom, abundance and security comes first,” bacevich says. “everything else figures as an afterthought.”bacevich’s argument is heavy-handed at times, but when he writes about military strategy, he is genuinely incisive. citing numerous examples, he convincingly argues that destructive myths about the efficacy of american military power blind policy makers, generals and voters. the use of overwhelming lethal force does not immediately cause dictators or terrorists to turn tail and run, even if that’s what politicians in washington want to believe. rather, it often leads to resentment, chaos and resistance.a presumption that using military power signified to friends and foes that washington was getting serious about a problem diminished the role of diplomats and diplomacy. “\\u200a‘getting serious’ also implied a preference for uniforms over suits as the principal agents of u.s. policy,” bacevich writes. “henceforth, rather than military power serving as the handmaiden of diplomacy, the reverse would be true.”in another repeated mistake, triumphalist american commanders prematurely declare victory without realizing that their opponent has simply withdrawn to fight another day as a guerrilla force, as occurred in afghanistan in 2001. they also personalize the enemy, wrongly assuming that the removal of figures like saddam hussein, osama bin laden and muammar qaddafi will instantly end conflict.from somalia in 1993 to yemen today, american commanders and policy makers overestimated the advantage american military technology bestows on them. and most crucially of all, the united states has failed to decide whether it is, in fact, at war.',\n",
       " \"“in the war for the greater middle east, the united states chose neither to contain nor to crush, instead charting a course midway in between,” bacevich writes. “instead of intimidating, u.s. military efforts have annoyed, incited and generally communicated a lack of both competence and determination.” the historical forces at work in the middle east are different from the dynamics that led to american victories in world war ii and the cold war. american officials have failed to understand that. what’s more, a deluded washington foreign policy establishment believes that an american way of life based on “consumption and choice” will be accepted over time in the “islamic world.”but it is here, in his description of the “islamic world,” that bacevich stumbles. what is missing in this book about “the greater middle east” are the people of the greater middle east. bacevich’s most highly developed muslim character in these pages is saddam hussein. the former afghan president hamid karzai is a distant second. beyond those two, the rest of the world’s estimated 1.6 billion muslims come across as two-dimensional caricatures.and so bacevich lumps together vastly different nationalities — from bosnians to iraqis to somalis — often referring to all of them primarily as “muslims.” the dizzying complexities of each country’s history, politics, culture, resources and rivalries are missing. and when it comes to how “muslims” view the world, bacevich veers into the simplistic essentialism that he accuses washington policy makers of following.bacevich suggests that in the “islamic world” lifestyles based on “consumption and choice” might not work. such broad-brush statements might well be considered simplistic and even bigoted if applied to other faiths. can one contend that a “christian world,” “hindu world” or “jewish world” exists? are such generalizations analytically useful? do the world’s hundreds of millions of muslims practice their faith identically?as a result of this essentialism, bacevich glosses over a vital point about the middle east today: a historic and brutal struggle between radicals and modernists for the future of the region is underway. one can argue that the united states has no place in that fight, but making sweeping generalizations about muslims as bacevich does limits our understanding of the forces at work in the region. it also plays into the hands of extremists who seek to divide the world by faith.in the most troubling passage of the book, bacevich breezily questions pluralism itself. “according to one of the prevailing shibboleths of the present age, this commingling of cultures is inherently good,” he writes. “it fosters pluralism, thereby enriching everyday life. yet cultural interaction also induces friction, whether spontaneously generated or instigated by demagogues and provocateurs.”we do live in a dangerous world, but it is also an inevitably interconnected one. the commingling of cultures cannot be stopped. nor should it be.for all that, bacevich is right that the united states’ reflexive use of armed intervention in the middle east is folly. an unquestioning faith in military might and an underinvestment in diplomacy has tied washington in a policy straitjacket. bacevich’s call for americans to rethink their nation’s militarized approach to the middle east is incisive, urgent and essential.david rohde is the national security investigations editor for reuters and a contributing editor for the atlantic. a version of this review appears in print on april 17, 2016, on page br17 of the sunday book review with the headline: perils of triumphalism.  today's paper|subscribe\",\n",

       " 'somehow i have managed to be sbtb’s resident geek reviewer for almost six years without every reading sweet starfire\\xa0by jayne ann krentz, and let me tell you, this book is simply delightful. there are giant bugs and snakes and river monsters. there is fashion. there’s a dingy spaceship and futuristic gambling. there’s a brooding bad boy who isn’t too bad and a very sweet ingénue who totally kicks ass. there’s a fluffy alien pet with three rows of teeth – like a super snuggly, deadly cat. the cover has pink and fuchsia. you can’t ask for much more from life than this.the hero of this story is named teague severance, because of course he is, and he is a wolf (not literally). wolves are basically regular human beings, although severance really plays up the “wolf” moniker – he’s a loner with a lot of aggression. he’s very rugged and cynical; you know the type. cidra, the heroine, wants severance to let her earn her passage on his cargo ship. cidra was born to two harmonics – people who, in contrast to wolves, achieve great serenity and perfect telepathic communication. cidra has the cultural traits of harmonics, but lacks the telepathic skills. she hopes that if she travels enough, she’ll find a key to unlocking those skills so that she can become a true harmonic. commence intergalactic road trip and romance between opposites!i had great fears about this book because the 1986 edition features an inside front page blurb from the publisher with these inspiring words, “i didn’t rape you, cidra.” good heavens. i can’t think of worse words with which to advertise a book. in my experience, generally when someone says, “i didn’t rape you” what they mean is “i totally raped you i’m just choosing not to think of it that way because i’m an asshole.”it is with vast relief that i inform you all that all the sex in this book is consensual. severance’s comment has to do with his fear that cidra might not be able to handle the intensity of sex after the fact, and that she might be blaming him for the sex, but cidra is always quite sex-positive, to severance’s mingled delight and chagrin:harmonics in general don’t seem very interested in sex, as we both know. once i am one, i will also probably lose interest. in the meantime, there is something to be learned, and last night i had a sudden, unexpected interest in learning.oh, cidra, how i adore you. cidra could be an impossible character, too good for this saintly earth, if not for the fact that she’s so funny and so tough. cidra comes from an incredibly sheltered environment, one almost devoid of conflict. the harmonic ideal is one of calm, formality, and mental communion as opposed to physical intimacy (of any kind – even her parents never hug her). as soon as she leaves home she finds herself in the middle of bar fights, and searching through abandoned temples, and learning to gamble, and hunting small animals when necessary for survival (although she never stops being vegetarian under normal circumstances).the very first time someone attacks cidra, she knocks the guy out. it’s her first fight. severance rushes in to save her and finds her standing over the unconscious body of her foe:“what, exactly, did you do?”“it’s called moonlight and mirrors. it’s a kind of dance. an exercise, really. but it’s based on a very old self-defense technique. my instructors always said i had a unique style of interpretation,” she added lamely.the scene sums up a lot of the tone of the book – it’s funny, but there’s real menace in the attack. cidra and severance both assume that she’s going to be dependent on him, given his expertise in the wolf culture, but cidra can actually stand up for herself very efficiently.this book\\xa0has a fun pulp science fiction quality to it when cidra and severance crash land on a hostile jungle planet. i loved the action and the mystery and the humor, and the scenes of cidra and severance hanging out on the spaceship. the pacing is excellent – there are enough action scenes to keep the book moving, and enough quiet scenes to allow for believable character development. cidra is a more complex and compelling character than severance, but the two characters play off each other in an incredibly entertaining way.by the end of the book, not only did i want these two crazy kids to wind up together, but i could picture their future lives. sometimes in romance there’s so much keeping two characters apart that the couple’s resolution seems overly optimistic. in this book, i understood the conflict, but by the end cidra in particular had become such a tough, shrewd spacefarer, without losing her core values and personality, that i could totally picture her and severance flying side by side. and while cidra will keep pants and a shirt handy (she found them very helpful for jungle hiking), i’m sure for the most part she’ll be wearing fantastic clothes of “delicate yellow-gold fabric spun of the finest crystal moss.”you just can’t beat crystal moss for fashion and style, or so i hear from the harmonics.this book is available from:1986',\n",
       " 'one of my favorite sonnets by shakespeare is number 50, for the circuitry between rider and horse on this woeful journey, its sounds that mimic a sad plodding, an image that encapsulates so much of the poem’s pain, its invisible impetus, and its solemn mood, which will not relent.the image of an hourglass – sand streaming down, glass tipped to begin again, the fluidity of that back and forth – comes to mind when i picture the speaker upon his horse, that poor beast bearing human burden, human woe, human weight, who then is spurred, not to move faster, but out of human anger. the horse’s groan of physical pain is felt in the rider’s mind, and there is no salve for either. horse and man, flesh and emotion, are bound together as one circuit of pain, testing the limit of what can be borne, until it is met and released through wound and sound.\\xa0sonnet 50how heavy do i journey on the way,when what i seek, my weary travel’s end,doth teach that ease and that repose to say,‘thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!’the beast that bears me, tired with my woe,plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,as if by some instinct the wretch did knowhis rider lov’d not speed being made from thee.the bloody spur cannot provoke him on,that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide,which heavily he answers with a groan,more sharp to me than spurring to his side;for that same groan doth put this in my mind,my grief lies onward, and my joy behind.\\xa0how heavily the poem begins, the words ‘heavy,’ ‘journey,’ ‘way,’ filled with such weight that to read them aloud mimics the plodding steps. a faint respite is in the second line with the word ‘seek’ (that light, searching word), only to return, heavily, with ‘weary travel’s end.’ these three words seem exhausted. and we’re still only at the beginning.along the lines of word invoking mood, ‘provoke’ seems itself so spur-like. the p a soft leaning against horseflesh, the r digging in harder, the sharpness of the v and k like metal teeth, the o and o of the held center. doesn’t the word seem so much like a little spur?and what precedes this rich ‘provoke’ is the masterful image of the bloody spur, which, encapsulates so well the grief, the soreness, the banal pain of this journey. the blood belongs to the horse, yes, with the spur being pain’s medium, but the blood seems also to belong to the rider, since man and animal are fused throughout. i adore the vividness of this bloody spur, how visible it is in the poem’s center and in my mind.as a counterpart, what (or who) is invisible is also essential, this ‘friend,’ that ‘joy’ left miles ago. nowhere and yet everywhere, source of anguish and tension, that estrangement of love-left-behind looms with every step of the poem.i appreciate this poem’s mood of despair, which does not lift. i love its slow insistence, which mirrors the action within it: there is nothing but grief to reach. there is no happy ending, yet it moves forward with a steadiness and nobility that is moving.i’m returning to this poem after completing a collection of poems based on japanese edo-period (1603-1868) artworks. one inspirational painting was ‘young samurai on horseback’ by okumura masanobu. depicted is a young man on his decorated horse, getting ready to leave for war, with two women whispering behind a window in the house he is leaving. his isolation is palpable, as is the horse’s impatience. i think about this man in contrast to shakespeare’s rider, who is instead in the middle of his journey, and it seems that there is no more tortuous, more downtrodden place to be then en route, with all of that time to think and feel above the hoof-beats.\\xa0\\xa0image\\xa0©\\xa0rembrandt ',\n",

       " 'it was 2001 when i first listened to yoko ono’s music. i was young and quite stupid and mostly alone. i’d walk around new york with no particular aim, trekking from my job in midtown to a subway station in soho because i had nowhere better to be. i took my lunch (one-dollar coffee, banana) in the bakery across the street from my shitty office, where i’d read and smoke (indoors!). i was broke, but buying things made me feel alive. i’d pick up remainders at coliseum books, or vintage porn from a sidewalk vendor on seventh avenue. one day, on a whim, i bought ono’s 1982 album it’s alright (i see rainbows). it was, perhaps unsurprisingly, on sale.if i didn’t like yoko ono myself, i might think someone who called himself a fan was joking, or engaged in some other thing: adolescent contrarianism or camp, possibly diva worship of those giant porsche sunglasses, those hats, those short shorts, those gams, the incontrovertible foreignness of ono’s english. for a long time ono was basically despised, the inevitable lot of someone married to a person whose fame actually may have eclipsed christ’s. fools hate foreigners, and fools hate women, but a lot of people who ought to know better hate the avant-garde, and a lot of people who ought to know better hate the politically engaged, and a lot of people who ought to know better hate polymaths, and ono is all those things. i think that now the line among sophisticates is that ono’s musical project is so idiosyncratic you can respect it without quite enjoying it, but i’ve never considered myself a sophisticate.i associate yoko ono’s music with our first year of george w. bush’s ruinous presidency, prophetess for a new year/decade/century/millennium. that september morning, i watched smoke pluming up over the williamsburg savings bank (then dentist’s offices, now luxury condominiums) from my bedroom window. i strolled through fort greene park, where people, no doubt driven mad by watching television, were playing tennis. that night, i listened to ono’s album rising, on headphones connected to my discman.that album was suited to that day: war has long been one of ono’s abiding preoccupations, and war was in the air. “towns burning/ throats choking/ watch out/ check out.” indeed, i did check out. i left new york to live alone in a big empty house in the woods, where i spent months writing five hundred pages of a truly horrible novel and listening to rising repeatedly. i had no television, i had one book (the ambassadors, for some stupid reason), and i had nightmares almost nightly. ono entertained me. “you are a new york woman/ i miss you/ i miss you/ i miss you, my friend,” she sang, and it seemed like she was talking about the women who would have been my friends, if i had any.on one of the album’s later songs, “where do we go from here,” ono sings, “are we getting tired of blood and horror? are we getting ready for god and terror?” that rising was released in 1996 makes ono seem prescient. i went back to new york in the spring of 2002 and found it so full of god and terror that i couldn’t take the subway, and broke down into tears when a lunatic at pathmark called me a faggot. i never finished writing that novel.it probably means i’m a philistine that i never simply listen to music; it’s a secondary consideration, something to accompany me on a commute, while washing dishes, on those rare horrible occasions i decide to go for a run. i respond to music emotionally rather than intellectually, which feels like a failing, if a common one. at some point a couple of years ago, i trained myself to write at night instead of during the day; it was easier to sustain focus after the children were asleep, and i was tired all the time because of the children anyway. i used music to modulate those late nights, giving those hours a rhythm: easy, then invigorating, then calming.that nightly cycle almost always involved revisiting that first record of ono’s i had bought. “my man” is a daffy, earnest love song that’s almost certainly about john lennon\\xa0(“when he speaks/ all the birds come around”). it’s sung, rather than screamed — the notion of ono as banshee isn’t an altogether fair one\\xa0—\\xa0and it calmed me. “spec of dust,” another song that’s probably about lennon, a paean to the idea that love is timeless, made me sad. “why do i miss you so/ if you’re just a spec of dust/ floating, endlessly, amongst a billion stars?”that record, with its songs of love and rage, made me remember being a dumb twenty-something, full of both: love for some theoretical boyfriend, rage at my creative/financial/professional impotence. most feel this way as teens and get into punk rock or start a shitty band all their own, but i had an arrested adolescence, not uncommon, i think, when you grow up gay but refuse to think about it, and so i had yoko ono. listening to her in my thirties, in the middle of the night, my husband and children asleep upstairs, i remembered the years in which i was without a husband, without children, and without the discipline to write a book.i love hearing people’s advice about books to read, exhibitions to attend, films to see, but i am utterly incurious about what music people recommend, because i ask that music perform this service for me, that it entertain me in the moment while also offering some memory of a moment long passed. dionne warwick reminds me of those early days of parenthood, my older son lolling around on a blanket and frowning; kate bush’s sixth record reminds me so much of a desperate summer i spent lovelorn in boston that i can barely bear to listen to it. it’s an imperfect way of listening, of consuming, of course; emotions ruin everything.*there are the songs i enjoy because they remind me of some previous time, some previous self, and there are the songs i enjoy because they are tidy, perfect texts of which i am professionally jealous. ono has always had a flair for language. undoubtedly her best-known work is the phrase “war is over! if you want it,” a line in “happy xmas,” the song she co-wrote with her late husband, but more famously the advertising slogan of yoko ono inc., on behalf of all humanity, stark black on pure white in filthy times square.there’s an unadorned clarity to her writing, which might have something to do with her long association with fluxus, the self-serious art movement that preferred strong words and uncollectable action and performance to a traditional conception of art. the movement was big on disarming straight talk. ono’s book grapefruit is pure fluxus: silly and impossible instructions for actions, process as product. i love that you still see pretty undergrads buying copies of it at the strand every fall. this is why ono is so great at twitter, a medium where she has had a renaissance — she’s been able to talk directly to an audience that might otherwise not know much about her beyond the obvious.ono’s oeuvre contains many turns of phrase that i envy — one of my favorite songs is her “all day long i felt like smashing my face in a clear glass window” which has the very clarity that makes her tweets, and grapefruit, so perfect. her songs are poetry that never sound much like poetry, unlike many of morrissey’s songs, which i can never listen to when i work because i end up writing ersatz smiths lyrics, with opaque references to the royal family.but of course the real standard by which you measure a song is more animal than intellectual. in the story “signs and symbols,” nabokov wrote of referential mania, the delusion that all the world — the most innocuous action, the simple existence of some thing — is somehow about you. i imagine we all suffer from this mania when it comes to judging art (hence this passion to see ourselves in the pages of a book) but of course, there’s some other, ineffable thing to the equation. ono has written a lot of great songs. she’s also written a lot of not great songs, as have most people engaged in this pursuit. the sound of some of ono’s songs — “she gets down on her knees,” “i have a woman inside my soul,” “loneliness,” “sisters o sisters” — simply works for me; music and the savage beast and all that.ono can and does caterwaul, and i get why people snicker at that. it’s aggressive and weird and disorienting and to laugh at it is an obvious response, if a superficial one. the live version of “don’t worry kyoko,” on ono’s 1972 record with lennon, some time in new york city, is bracing, electric, astonishing. you needn’t know the backstory — kyoko is ono’s daughter, the subject of a custody dispute so bitter they were wholly separated for decades — to hear the raw expression of pain leavened by maternal comfort in ono’s screams. in the soundtrack to ono’s remarkably unsettling short film “fly,” she delivers a vocal performance that defies description. it’s worth listening to, even if you can only manage to listen to it once; i think the same can be fairly said of the composer kaija saariaho or many other difficult artists. but leave aside this aggressively avant-garde work if you like; “the death of samantha” and “walking on thin ice” are great rock and roll songs. it’s incredible to me that the same artist could manage to have made both.*my children are older now, and i’ve gone soft, the abbreviated schedule of their infant sleep somehow forgotten. a few weeks ago, i tried to reclaim the night for myself, those stretches of hours that had proved so fertile, so essential, only a couple of years ago. it was in part superstition and in part the simple need to keep myself awake, but i tried to recreate the specific rhythm of those productive nights: ease, then energy, then quietude. i began with the brandenberg concertos, but bach’s cool mathematics often make me sleepy. i played “don’t worry kyoko,” to rouse myself, then the computer offered me “is winter here to stay?,” a song of ono’s that i’ve long liked. i was surprised to find that what i remembered, with a sensory clarity that was almost frightening, was not that time alone in a far-away house in 2001 but a similar night alone in the house i still call home. i remembered two years ago, i remembered a tumbler of watery whisky, damp with condensation, the oppressive heat of new york in june, the lack of absolute silence even at two o’clock in the morning, the reassuring sense that everyone i loved was asleep upstairs.it’s a confounding thing that art can endure. i don’t mean over the ages — what does that matter, we’re destroying the planet — but in our lives. art is a conversation between you and someone you’ve probably never met, and that conversation can continue for so long. yoko ono, who once reminded me of being twenty-three and watching the world blow up, now reminds me of being thirty-six, old enough to have built a world anew for myself. i don’t know why this should be, but i’m grateful that it is. when she screams don’t worry, i almost believe her.\\xa0image:\\xa0i bought this oddity on ebay in the middle of the night. it purports to be a wire service news bulletin, and i can’t imagine it’s not authentic because who would fake such a thing? the manner in which ono is discussed in this says a great deal. i like to imagine ono, who has played with language throughout her long career, would be amused at rather than hurt by its casual cruelty. it’s dated the day after john lennon was murdered.\\xa0',\n",

is it someone else with a grudge against her?you know what to do. read it and find out. but before you do, see what katie ruggle has to say about ice rescue, small towns, and crafting suspense in remote locations.\\xa0amazon book review: your heroine, lou sparks, has moved to an off-the-grid cabin in colorado after leaving her more affluent life in connecticut behind her. what about lou and her fresh start do you think readers will find appealing?katie ruggle: i imagine almost everyone has thought, at some time or another, “i hate my job/school/relationship/life. i’m running away to the mountains/beach/island/cleveland.” (okay, maybe not the last one.) for most, these escape plans never get past the daydream stage, but lou actually did it. she left life as she knew it behind and moved to a tiny, off-grid, scarily remote cabin. how wonderful and terrifying is that?lou admits to callum in hold your breath that she didn’t even know how to light a fire before she arrived in simpson. the only heat source in her cabin is her wood stove. in order to not freeze to death, she had to figure it out—fast. lou’s first winter in the mountains is a story of survival, of learning everything she needs to know in order to hold onto her newfound independence. not only does she stay alive, but she thrives—and she never loses her sense of humor. i think readers will be drawn to lou’s courage and tenacity as she struggles not only to keep herself alive, but to help others as part of the rescue dive team.hold your breath opens with lou going through ice-rescue training—and she uses that training later in a critical scene. you yourself have been certified in ice rescue. how often have you had to use that training in real life? unfortunately (or maybe fortunately? that water is cold!), i haven’t used the training as much as i’d have liked. after becoming certified, it started to snow…and snow and snow. i was living off-grid in the mountains at the time (although my system was not as bare-bones as lou’s; i’m a big believer in backup plans—and backup generators). as the wind howled and the snow hardened into rock-like drifts, i developed a new understanding of the term “cabin fever.”several times, when the plow would finally, finally pass by my house, i was tempted to run out and wave down the driver, just so i could talk face-to-face with a real, live person. by exercising a huge amount of willpower, i managed to resist plow-chasing.since i was stuck in my house for weeks at a time, it was impossible to get to the fire station for training or to go on calls. now that i’m in minnesota, i’m planning to volunteer for the local fire department and dust off my ice-rescue skills as soon as i find a spare minute. with its multitude of lakes and the frigid winter temperatures, i’m thinking that minnesota will offer plenty of opportunities for me to jump into cold water (um…yay?). lou and callum seem to have an opposites-attract relationship, but they’re both committed to helping others. what else do they have in common that gives their romance a solid foundation?despite their differences regarding, say, the cleanliness of their pickups or their window-blind-hanging techniques, lou and callum respect each other. they are both smart, courageous, strong people, and they know that these positive traits are what matter. the little things—like lou’s chaos-causing tendencies or cal’s insistence on arranging the firewood in a very specific, very orderly way—are insignificant—endearing, even. they truly like one another, and that’s a pretty sturdy foundation for a relationship.the details of the murder aren't resolved by the end of hold your breath, so clearly we’re going to return to colorado to find out more. whose story is next in the series, or will you continue to explore the evolution of lou and callum’s relationship in the next book?although lou and callum show up quite a bit in fan the flames, the second book in the series, they won’t be the main players. firefighter and mc member ian, along with gun-shop owner rory, will take center stage in this one. doing research on this book was a blast (ha! please excuse my unintentional pun); my inner gun nerd had such a great time.what aspects of a small town in the rockies made it the perfect setting for your search-and-rescue series?i love writing about small towns. there’s something so comforting—yet claustrophobic—about places where everyone knows everyone else’s business. the setting plays a huge part in building suspense, too. after i moved to the colorado rockies, it took me a while to truly understand the meaning of the word “remote.” in the city where i’d previously been living, the average response time for first responders (police, ambulance or firefighters) was six minutes. in my new mountain home, it was seventeen—and that was on a good day. when there was a blizzard and/or icy roads and/or closed mountain passes and/or a herd of bighorn sheep hanging out on the highway, this response time could be stretched even longer.it’s scary enough to hear someone trying to break into your home when you’re in the middle of civilization. you can call 9-1-1, and the police will be there in a handful of minutes. you can scream, and your more helpful and/or nosy neighbors will be there in seconds. help is close and plentiful.but what if you’re alone in a mountain cabin with a bad guy at the door? you try to call, but there’s no cell reception. you scream, but only the burglar and the coyotes can hear you. there’s no help. there’s just you—and the bad guy.scary, right? and that’s why it’s a perfect setting for a romantic suspense.what have you read lately that you’ve been recommending to friends or other readers?with trying to squeeze writing and editing into the small window between a night baking job and sleep, i’ve sadly fallen behind in my reading. however, i did manage to cram in\\xa0the wall of winnipeg and me by mariana zapata. after staying up all day reading, i was a bread-making zombie the next night, but the book was totally worth the sleep deprivation. i love her characters so very much.\\xa0you might also like:\\xa0subscribe to omnivoracious: the amazon book review for our picks of best books of the month, author interviews, reading recommendations, and more from the amazon books editorsshop this article on amazon.com\",\n",

       " 'global population is aging rapidly. over the next four decades the number of individuals aged 60 years and older will nearly triple to more than 2 billion in 2050 (un, 2013). with the aging of the population, the burden and cost of chronic disease will escalate worldwide. in order to ensure healthy and successful aging and reduce the cost of care for this huge increase, building resilience and wellbeing among the aging becomes a top priority for individuals, families, and society at large. complementary and integrative medicine (cim) is well positioned to offer interventions leading to prevention of major mental and physical diseases of aging and improve the quality of life for aging individuals and their families.cim therapies are defined by the national center for complementary and integrative health (nccih) as “a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered a part of conventional medicine” (nccih-nih, 2015). the most recent comprehensive assessment of cim use in the united states found that roughly 40% of us adults had used at least one cim therapy within the past year (2007), spending billions of dollars out-of-pocket on these therapies. the use of cim for treatment of mood and anxiety disorders includes acupuncture, deep breathing exercises, massage therapy, meditation, naturopathy, and yoga. the most commonly used cim health techniques in general population include prayer for health and the use of multivitamin supplementation. given widespread use of integrative or mind-body medicine among our patients, there is an urgent need for greater awareness of the applications and outcomes of the commonly used mind-body interventions.mind-body medicine encompasses a number of techniques collectively known as mindful exercise (e.g. yoga, qigong and tai chi), or meditation. mindful physical exercise has become an increasingly utilized approach for improving psychological well-being and is defined as “physical exercise executed with a profound inwardly directed contemplative focus.” in general, mindful physical exercise contains the following key elements: (1) a non-competitive, non-judgmental meditative component, (2) mental focus on muscular movement and movement awareness combined with a low to moderate level of muscular activity, (3) centered breathing, (4) a focus on anatomic alignment (i.e., spine, trunk, and pelvis) and proper physical form, (5) energy-centric awareness of individual flow of intrinsic body energy, otherwise known as life force, prana, chi, or kundalini. the mindful exercise has been shown to provide an immediate source of relaxation and mental quiescence. scientific evidence has shown that medical conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance, depression, and anxiety disorders respond favorably to the mindful exercises.there is a growing database of the physiological effects of mindful exercise and meditation. tai chi and qi gong have been shown to promote relaxation and decrease sympathetic output, and to benefit anxiety, depression, blood pressure, and recovery from immune-mediated diseases. both\\xa0have been shown to improve immune function and vaccine-response. these practices have also been shown to increase blood levels of endorphins and baroreflex sensitivity, and to reduce levels of inflammatory markers (crp), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (acth), and cortisol, implicating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis as a mediator of stress and anxiety reduction.studies of meditation also report decreased sympathetic nervous activity and increased parasympathetic activity associated with decreased heart rate and blood pressure, decreased respiratory rate, and decreased oxygen metabolism. in our recently published study of kundalini yoga compared to memory training in older adults with subjective memory complaints, we found that the yoga group demonstrated a significant improvement in depression and visuospatial memory compared to the memory training group. both interventions improved verbal memory performance. improved verbal memory performance was associated with increased connectivity between the language processing brain network. these findings point at the potential of using yoga to offset and delay cognitive decline, improve mood and coping with stress, and enhance brain plasticity.given the noninvasive nature of mindful exercise and meditation, recommending these exercises to all those interested in stress reduction and to patients with mental disorders generally seems an appropriate option for consumers and clinicians, particularly for conditions that have been studied in controlled studies. some of these preventive techniques will include stress reduction that will enhance resilience to stress, and can improve cognition. many of these techniques can be learned outside of the medical system and include exercise, lifestyle changes, mindfulness and mindful exercise, and the use of any joyful activities that can enhance the quality of life of older adults and their families. ethical considerations should be taken into account when practicing or recommending spiritual interventions by healthcare professionals to respect patients’ beliefs in choosing mind-body interventions.featured image credit: group of people practicing yoga, by\\xa0eli christman. cc by-2.0 via wikimedia commons.',\n",

       " 'when i entered my sophomore year of high school, my world literature teacher, ms. sarah wilson, assigned us leslie marmon silko’s \"ceremony.\" in this book, i saw reflections of myself, of my family and friends, of brown faces that were already all too familiar to me. ceremony led me to ralph ellison’s \"invisible man,\" which led me to gloria anzaldúa’s \"borderlands.\" these books formed my identity as a fronterizo, a child of the hyphen between mexican and american. for the first time i was learning that my histories, and that of my ancestors’, were part of u.s. history.i became an active participant in the tucson youth poetry slam, or typs, a competitive poetry reading series for high schoolers from across the region. i began writing and performing poems about mi raza, my family, my community and myself. inspired by anzaldúa and león de la rosa, i write my poetry in spanglish to capture the tongue-dance of my upbringing.',\n",
       " 'with a newfound appreciation for literature and a constant evolution of ideas about identity and history, my poetry became an outlet for all the emotions i never had words for. thanks to the typs and its mother organization spoken futures, i read my poems across arizona and have read in spaces where poetry had previously been unthought\\xa0of. in 2012, this included a school board candidate forum.the tucson unified school district had stopped sending school buses to pick up students attending pueblo without warning the community. students forced to walk or take public transportation were showing up late to class and being penalized. \\xa0i was a part of pueblo high’s movimiento estudiantil chicana/o de aztlán, or mecha, chapter, and we organized a forum about the inequity of transportation for southside schools in tucson. we invited school board members and candidates running for school board seats. to no surprise, the incumbent members declined our invitation, but all of the candidates running were in attendance. before we started the forum, i performed a bilingual poem about the history of segregation and inequality in tucson’s education system. three months later, two of the candidates were elected as board members — and yellow buses returned to pueblo.in 2014, a year after i graduated, i published my first collection of poetry, \"tortoise boy says,\" with spoken futures press. it’s a culmination of my experiences as a young chicano navigating the spectrums of identity and language in arizona. i believe in the importance of empowering youth to find their voices and stories, this act is survival and resistance — it certainly was for me.especially now, in a moment in time where politicians and public figures like donald trump and maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio are speaking to the deeply rooted racist and sexist sentiments of the u.s.’ white power structure. platforms for marginalized voices are more important than ever to add depth to what it means to be an american.there is urgency in the poems written by black, brown, native, asian, undocumented, queer and trans writers that cannot be understood without first recognizing why we are standing up, writing and performing: we are — and have been — done with being passive recipients of cultural and physical violence simply because of our bodies and experiences. coming of age in arizona, where racist legislation has targeted the mexican and chicana/o community, the talk of deportations and 50-foot border walls is nothing new. \\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0thinking about my experience as a young poet of color, i understand how important my occupancy in literary and cultural spaces is, but i recognize that i am a cis-gendered, able-bodied, heterosexual chicano. if i in turn failed to recognize who’s not in the room, i repeat the cycle of erasure. hence this continual work to amplify voices that have gone unheard — just as mine was in my early teens. in solidarity with black lives matter and ni una mas, movements that demand the rehumanization of people stripped of their essence, i acknowledge the miraculous nature of being brown and proud and loud, of being mexcellent, of being alive and thriving with poems rolling off my tongue like prayers.enrique garcía naranjo is a poet, performer and pocho from tucson. he is a tucson youth poetry slam alumnus and a spoken futures inc staff member. his work has been published by and included in the acentos review, brown, proud y loud zine, sunday kinfolk and more. recently, garcía naranjo finished his third borderlands theatre production, \\'\"he ghosts of lote bravo\"\\xa0by hilary bettis. between reading and performing, garcía naranjo can be found crate digging for vinyl to sample.\\xa0',\n",

       " 'the romanovs1613-1918by simon sebag montefioreillustrated. 744 pp. alfred a. knopf. $35.the story of the romanov dynasty began in 1613 with michael romanov, chosen as russia’s czar in the time of troubles, and ended in 1918 with alexei romanov, shot alongside his parents and sisters in the basement of a house in the urals. during the three turbulent centuries that separated these two “fragile, innocent and ailing” boys, the dynasty produced 20 monarchs and several regents, including two rulers of genius — peter and catherine, the “greats.” the czars wielded absolute power and led lives that were truly extraordinary, larger than other lives, consecrated by the mystical mission, the sacred compact between the ruler and russia — the compact whose roots went deep into the medieval land of peasants and rituals, of myth and religion, of byzantine icons and golden eagles, yet which survived, virtually unchanged, into the 20th century, until swept away by the \\xadrevolution.in his mammoth 744-page opus, “the romanovs,” simon sebag montefiore, the eminent biographer of joseph stalin and grigory potemkin, covers the entire dynasty, from its rise to its apogee to its fall — an enterprise that has been accomplished only twice before, for reasons that become apparent just pages into the volume: it takes true historical daring to tackle such an immense subject.the romanovs inhabited a world of turmoil and excess, “a world where obscure strangers suddenly claim to be dead monarchs reborn, brides are poisoned, fathers torture their sons to death, sons kill fathers, wives murder husbands, .\\u2008.\\u2008. barbers and peasants ascend to supremacy,” and more and more. endless visions of horror, splendor and absurdity — chopped-off heads soaked in vodka and courtiers traveling with their own portable gardens, children roasted and eaten in pogroms and wedding palaces carved out of ice, courtiers made to dress as chickens and sit clucking for hours and carriages pulled by bears — crowd one another so closely that the sheer concentration of history can become overwhelming. so dense is the material, in fact, that a single page bears the accounts of czar alexei’s courtship and marriage, a conspiracy involving accusations of sorcery, the birth of peter the great, the cossack uprising of stenka razin complete with razin’s gruesome execution, and a governmental reshuffle thrown into a footnote; and such pages are far from rare. (the footnotes, incidentally, contain some of the liveliest details, so readers are well advised not to skip them.)',\n",
       " 'the backbone of the narrative, the theme that underlies the wealth of information, is the nature of autocracy, with its daily power struggles, succession troubles, assassination attempts, plots and rebellions. montefiore describes his work as “a study of character and the distorting effect of absolute power on personality,” “a family story of love, marriage, adultery and children” made “extraordinary because power both sweetens and contaminates the traditional familial chemistry.” other themes run through the book as well — the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities and the role of chance in history among them — but the author’s investigation into the nature of power, “that mysterious, invisible alchemy of personality, fear and authority,” remains his foremost concern. his insights tend to be pithy and sharp. “the vanishing of royal children at the hands of power-hungry relatives has a fitting way of destroying the very power they seek,” he says of the murky death of ivan the terrible’s youngest son, dmitri. “as an autocrat becomes older, the struggle for influence intensifies, which in turn makes the sovereign more suspicious and therefore more dangerous,” he comments on the reign of anna, while the assassination of paul elicits an aside: “a fortress is only as safe as the men who guard it.”coming from the notable historian of stalin, such aphorisms carry much weight. one may wish for more of them, as well as more overall context, more grounding of the events in the general cultural and economic climate, which is touched upon infrequently and briefly. but, perhaps inevitably in a study so concentrated, montefiore’s approach favors facts over analysis and atmosphere. the facts themselves, many of them results of original research, are fascinating enough to speak for themselves, although there are occasional dry patches. wars tend to become chronological lists of commanders replaced, troops moved, fortresses taken and lost, as the same players — \\xadsweden, poland, the ottomans, later prussia, france, britain — jostle for prominence on the great chessboard of europe and later the world. discussions of interior policy at times resemble a relentless parade of back-stabbing courtiers rewarded, dismissed, executed, pardoned, with complex plots and alliances made doubly obscure by complicated family connections, until one can sympathize with the loutish alexander iii, who was prone to shouting, “as for the ministers, the devil take them.” montefiore’s novelistic gift of drawing vivid characters with a few choice words never fails him — a greedy favorite is likened to the “shark that can clean its gills only by eating more,” while an official is described as “snoozing astride foreign policy like a somnolent, sickly sloth”; but, given the encyclopedic nature of the work, minor personalities come and go abruptly, and their individual time on the stage is simply too brief to make them \\xaddistinguishable.the main portraits, on the other hand, are invariably memorable. here is the red-bearded giant alexei habitually tossing trussed-up boyars into a freezing river as punishment for their oversleeping his dawn church services; or peter the great having a beautiful ex-lover beheaded, then lifting her bloodied head, kissing it on the lips and lecturing the crowd on the windpipe and arteries; or the “russian venus” elizaveta banning her ladies from wearing her favorite color, pink, then punishing a beauty who dared to wear a pink rose in her hair by having her tongue ripped out at a scaffold; or catherine the great, in the midst of a predawn revolution that would make her the ruler of russia, commandeering a french hairdresser to fix her hair (“always important in a coup,” notes the author with a rare flash of humor). the rulers’ characters are further enriched by generous quotations from primary sources, including their own letters and diaries. (peter is forceful and blunt: “time is death.” catherine is cautious and manipulative: “one must do things in such a way that people think they themselves want it to be done this way.”)when the story moves into the 19th century, the age of the three alexanders and the two nicholases, the narrative slows down somewhat, taken over by military maneuvers and royal love affairs; yet there is always plenty of interest to keep one’s attention, until, at the turn of the 20th century, the drama intensifies once again as the story reaches the dark sweep of its spellbinding last chapters.given the profusion of scandalous events and characters like nicholas\\u202fii and rasputin who have passed from history into myth, it can be a challenge to keep the tone objective, and here montefiore succeeds with seeming ease, offering a scholar’s well-balanced perspective on some of the more notorious episodes. he dispels the myth of catherine the great as the “nymphomaniac of legend,” downplays the possibility that alexander i faked his own death and casually drops a number of bombshells that remain, appropriately, unexploded; for instance, catherine, wife of peter iii, claimed that their heir, the future paul i, born in 1754, was in actuality her lover’s son, prompting a single \\xadmatter-of-fact comment: “which would make the entire dynasty down to 1917 saltykov, not romanov.” the account remains even-keeled throughout, and the last years of the dynasty especially are treated with a restraint and objectivity for which one is grateful.',\n",

       " 'how can realism in science be defined? philosophers, historians, and the general public, have always related it to a philosophical doctrine or a technological effect. however, there is a type of realism — very widespread in science — that has gone unnoticed among scholars: the realist attitude of social and cultural origins. behind this attitude lie commercial and engineering interests. identifying this attitude is vital, because many scientists’ ideas were influenced by these kinds of interests.until now, the most known type of realism in science has been the operational one. the stanford school philosophers, ian hacking and nancy cartwright, held that scientists are justified in believing in the existence of theoretical entities only when they’re able to use them to produce effects. they called this fact “operational realism.” thus, the existence of an entity, such as an electron, can be established only through manipulation and experiment. what convinces scientists that they’re seeing electrons is no empirical adequacy of theory, but the fact that they can manipulate in a direct and tangible way to achieve certain results. in fact, hacking’s most famous motto says: “if you can spray them, then they’re real” — that is, an entity is real if we can manipulate it; so, manipulability is evidence of existence.however, the point made here is trickier. and interestingly, it’s closely linked to another fundamental question: how commercial interests shape scientific conceptions.few would deny the great influence of technology and industry on scientific progress, a topic that has provided valuable insight into how science depends on technical advances, how it depends on industry, and how it depends on the society in which it’s done. however, how, exactly, do these factors shape science? are industry and commerce just means that provide know-how and tools to science? or do they affect the concepts and values themselves of science? if so, how and to what extent?if there are sciences that regard their concepts and methods as pure knowledge, physics and the exact sciences are among them. they’re often taken as the archetype of sciences: their knowledge has never — or at most, slightly — been affected by “external” factors. physical advances, it is said, are well-founded, built on solid mathematical theories, and resistant to external influences. they’re “pure” knowledge, free of any commercial contamination, unaffected by factors such as industrial demands, commercial achievements, or social pressure. this, at least, is what a great part of the scientific literature contends.however, there are cases of industries that challenge the “purity” of science. i’ll mention two twin industries: both used artificially created waves as a means for exploration; both included academic scientists and industrial scientists; and both were related to geophysics. their stories are similar in some ways. the first has to do with the radio industry and with how this affected the study of the earth’s upper atmosphere (also known as ionosphere). during the interwar years, some leading radio physicists like edward v. appleton in britain and merle a. tuve in the us, claimed the discovery of the structure of the ionosphere — that is, the heaviside (e) layer, the lower (d) and upper (f) layers, and the f1 and f2 sub-layers.the second has to do with the oil industry and with how this affected the earth’s crust (or crustal seismology). during wwii and the post-war period, most of american physicists abandoned simple and idealised crustal models and put forward realist arguments regarding crustal layers. although their research areas were different, the two groups of physicists had one thing in common: they both adopted a realist attitude towards theoretical entities, such as layers and discontinuities.but the physicists’ realism was about concepts rather than theories. indeed, it stemmed not from a given philosophical doctrine (i.e. scientific realism), but from a pragmatic attitude. from the 1920s to 1950s, radio physicists and crustal geophysicists laid aside normative questions such as: what entities should we know?; what do we really know? instead, they asked factual questions, like: what kinds of entities are in the earth’s crust and in the ionosphere? what constitutes direct evidence for the existence of these entities, and what’s true of them?but here the key question is: is operational realism proper enough to explain the realist attitude of radio scientists and crustal geophysicists? everything appears to indicate that it isn’t. although wave manipulation might well have made the ionosphere seem more real, the emergence of realist attitudes occurred before wave experiments in the mid-1920s (these experiments were carried out by using the sounding-echo technique). before that, the marconi company’s radio engineers firmly believed in the existence of a reflecting layer in the ionosphere. similarly, the emergence of realist attitudes towards crustal layers occurred before wave experiments in the early 1950s (these were carried out through explosion seismology). if wave manipulation and intervention weren’t the primary cause, what led them to adopt realist attitudes? the answer is a “new” kind of realism: a realism of social and cultural origins. namely, an entity realism that responds to very specific interests: to commercial and engineering questions.for example, in the case of ionospheric exploration, radio engineers devised techniques assuming the existence of a reflecting layer in the upper atmosphere. (some years later, physicists emulated them in their sounding-echo experiments). for engineers and industrial scientists, there was a direct relationship between commercial achievement and the existence of the layers imagined in their planning.in other words, commercial success depended on the prediction of objectives. the prediction of questions, such as the maximum usable frequency and the location of oil bearings, was key for commercial success; and this was linked to the use of useful pictures of the earth’s inscrutable regions. therefore, much of their realist attitude had to do with the need to provide a useful picture of the ionosphere and the earth’s crust, with the need to predict objectives, with the need to reach commercial achievements.featured image credit: cascade by antonis lamnatos. cc-by-2.0 via flickr.

to answer that, i looked more at the eagle where i found the earliest ads—and where they survived for several decades longer than everywhere else. they are there in 1881, when one bold advertiser filled an entire page with ascii text. there are there in 1888, when the eagle advertised its election night almanac in the familiar large letters. they are there all the way up to july 3, 1892, a day the same brooklyn furniture company again ran a half-page ad with their address in large ascii letters. and, then, on july 5th, they were completely gone, replaced by modern layouts and fancy typography. those upgrades likely explain, at least in part, what happened. ascii art flourishes most when technology is limited; you don’t need print shop anymore when you can do digital layout on your computer and have an inkjet printer.”“the gift and curse of american hyperbole, truthful and otherwise, has lately been distilled in a single omnipresent word. in 2016, everything is ‘everything.’ that’s what the internet is telling us, at least. or yelling at us, in capital letters, with blaring hashtags attached. ‘@beyonce’s #metgala dress is everything,’ self magazine proclaimed recently on twitter … internet one-\\xadupsmanship is a definitively 21st-\\xadcentury art form, but “everything” carries a hint of yesteryear — a whiff of the hot air that once swirled through medicine-\\xadshow tents and carnival grounds … the internet has a way of placing all of us—you, me, the online peddler of counterfeit viagra, the editor of the paris review—in the undignified position of those touts who haunt the sidewalks outside bad restaurants in tourist-\\xadtrap neighborhoods, thrusting menus in the faces of passers-\\xadby.”in which edward docx attends the 2016 british esperanto conference: “there are few times in your life that you can be certain that you are doing what nobody else in the world is doing—or has ever done—or will likely do again. this was one of them. i was sitting at a table of six, with a catalan, a brazilian, a belgian, a londoner and a slovakian, while they munched and guzzled their way through their kareos and had what i can only describe as the most kinetic, exciting and involving conversation in esperanto that spice city (of stanley street, liverpool) is ever going to witness. the animation. the jokes. the asides. the soliloquys. the antanaclasis. oh, if only i had known what they were talking about i could have… i could have told you. but i was converted. the whole idea and application of esperanto was so obviously amazing, so demonstrably persuasive, so self-evidently practical that i forget all over again about english; english; english.”the internet is a fine place to find good writing. but it’s the best place to find moronic writing—just try. it’s such effective an effective moronic-writing delivery system that print media got jealous: “there are too many people filling every possible orifice of the internet with their idiot opinions and comical prejudices and poorly constructed arguments … but: have you seen what’s not on the internet?

       " 'j.j. abrams admits: \\'it\\'s not cloverfield 2\\' but it does have a monsterby alex billington february 26, 2016source: fandangofinally, the truth comes out. no, 10 cloverfield lane is not a cloverfield sequel. in fact, it has nothing to do with cloverfield (the original 2008 monster movie), producer j.j. abrams finally admits: \"this movie is very purposefully not called cloverfield 2, because it\\'s not cloverfield 2.\" however, what he\\'s getting at here is the \"bigger picture\" concept behind why cloverfield is in the title and what they\\'re going for: \"there is a bigger idea at play for us with these movies and this connection.\" essentially, movies made by bad robot that end up with \"cloverfield\" in the title or synopsis are part of a series of \"monster movies\" that deal with a big sci-fi threat - not specifically the same monster. abrams finally cleared the air about what to expect.ever since the first trailer for 10 cloverfield lane premiered in theaters, fans have been going crazy with excitement at the possibility that they made a cloverfield sequel in secret and it\\'s out in two months and no one knew. but of course, that was a bit too perfect to be true. the reality is that the project was produced under the name valencia and they did, at some point in production, change the title with the idea that it would connect into a bigger series of thrilling sci-fi movies that deal with a \"monster\" of some kind. abrams says this movie \"is definitely about different kinds of monsters,\" but obviously wouldn\\'t say more than that.erik davis of fandango talked with j.j. abrams recently and got a few key quotes from him (seen below) regarding what exactly 10 cloverfield lane is. obviously not much is fully revealed but it is worth reading.\"this movie is very purposefully not called cloverfield 2, because it\\'s not cloverfield 2,\" abrams says, adding that \"the association is clear and there are multiple connections – and there is a bigger idea at play for us with these movies and this connection.\"so does 10 cloverfield lane take place during the first cloverfield?\"no it doesn\\'t, but there\\'s a larger thing at play with these connections,\" abrams continues. \"and the fun of it is that some of these connections – and there\\'s a lot of them – are not the kind of connections you might think. so if you\\'re approaching it as a literal sequel, you\\'ll be surprised to see what this movie is. but while it\\'s not what you might expect from a movie that has the name \\'cloverfield\\' in it, i think you\\'ll find that you\\'ll understand the connection when you see the whole thing.\"so that means - go see it and you\\'ll know what he means and everything will be revealed, of course. arrives in theaters starting on march 11th next month. abrams adds a bit more about how it all came together:\"the story of this movie – and it came to us originally as a spec that was very different in a lot of ways and an unrelated thing altogether – is definitely about different kinds of monsters,\" he says. \"and while the cloverfield monster isn\\'t in this movie, there\\'s a new monster and there\\'s something else that happens… but i don\\'t want to ruin the ending.\"yes - so once again, go see the movie and everything will be revealed, but be on the lookout for hidden connections. i\\'m glad abrams is coming out with this - see the full interview on fandango. in a separate interview with ew, abrams adds: \"this is just this movie, and it\\'s only two films that we\\'re talking about right now. there is something else that we\\'d like to do, and hopefully we\\'ll get a shot.\" slashfilm speculates this could be another small script called god particle. and for those wondering, \"the decision to connect it to cloverfield happened a long time ago, but it was a very conscious decision not to announce it as such,\" abrams claims. i\\'m very curious to find out. will all our questions be answered in march? only j.j. knows.for those still wondering about the possibility of a cloverfield sequel, it\\'s not entirely off the table. abrams: \"there were a lot of ideas [for a follow-up] – at one point there was this really big idea for doing three different things at once. a lot of things were thrown around. but we now live in that post-godzilla, post-pacific rim era where those movies have been made, so what would we do?\" but here is still some hope: \"i was actually talking to drew [goddard] last week about what would happen if we continued that specific story [as told in the first cloverfield], and there are some fun ideas, but still not \\'the thing.\\' there\\'s a reason why the movie we\\'re talking about right now isn\\'t cloverfield 2, but something else entirely.\" i guess he means to say - they still haven\\'t figured out an innovative idea for cloverfield 2, but this movie is something interesting on its own, and is worth checking out anyway. sounds good - only a few weeks to go.for those interested in more of this world - the viral marketing arg underway for 10 cloverfield lane has exciting things going on. slashfilm has been covering it closely, reporting on games and other activities all based around a website at funandprettythings.com. the character john goodman plays, howard stambler, is running the site to keep in touch with his daughter - he posts updates here. there are hidden/subliminal images in the latest footage, which is very cool, connecting everything together which lead one reddit user to dig up a box buried at some coordinates, containing a few things including a usb drive with mysterious files on it. now that we\\'ve got you hooked, visit funandprettythings.com and figure out what all this means.find more posts in discuss, hype, movie news, scifidiscover more on zergnet:',\n",

       " 'the busy duo managed to find time to sit down with deadline to discuss the challenges- and appeal- of staying resolutely independent in an unforgiving industry.deadline: you guys are on a roll. how do you manage to keep everything afloat given how hard we keep hearing it is to get the kind of high-end fare you produce moving along?ek. we aim to make two films a year. we’re very hands on producers. we are still a very small company. there is only stephen and i, joanna laurey and two assistants. so there’s five of us. to make two films a year is quite a big ask for a company of our size but we really try. we have a development slate of i’d say about six or seven projects. it has just happened that those projects have come through in the way they have. with our conversion rate being so high, we have found by the time we get to the end of next year it means we might have come to the end of our slate. and we’ve never had that experience before. you become a victim of your conversion rate success because as a small company you can’t really afford to have this massive development slate and not get anything into production. it means we’ve kept it to projects we feel very passionate about and feel fit our sensibilities and our passions.sw: it’s a miracle because our slate is very small and we don’t plan to have a huge slate. we are looking now for the first time in a while at expanding the slate a little bit but we’re not out there just searching. the reality is that our projects organically grow. we’ve done a lot of projects with the same directors, the same writers. we enjoy an extremely good relationship with talent and that’s what our strength is. our strength has always been, from my first movies with neil jordan, from working closely on the scripts, working closely on conceptual ideas of what it is we are trying to achieve. we’re not dictatorial but at the same time we’re very hands on from the beginning, which means we generally are very close to the book, the ideas, the development, the development department, the partners, the process and we tend to take that through till the bitter end. that stretches all the way back to when we had palace pictures and when we were making films for distribution. we kind of knew we were having to make films to get to an audience. so we do like to think that we try and make films for audiences. we don’t simply sign on for the ride if some auteur or some writer says ‘i want to do this’. we are quite investigative in terms of the quality of the material and what we would like. which is not to say that if somebody walked in now with a great script that we wouldn’t go, “great we love this, too.”deadline: how do you get access to material. that is always the biggest challenge, isn’t it?ek: we were approached by indigo films, paolo sorrentino’s producers, to be the producers on youth. we read the script and loved it and we knew that they were talking to a few producers. we read the script on a wednesday, we flew to rome on the friday to have lunch with them because we felt so passionate about him and that particular project. and having michael caine attached – this is the fourth film that we’ve done with micheal – which was a big draw for us. we clinched the deal there and then at lunch. out of that has come a relationship with indigo where different projects have been passing between the two of us. we have one that’s in development and other scripts that they keep sending us, ideas we’ve been sending them. similarly with killer films. we have done two films together and now we are doing colette which is something they brought to us because it’s european based. they asked us to help shape the whole thing and push it forward. to have a spirit of collaboration that works with another small – like ourselves – production company and producers has also been something we’ve enjoyed in our company. to develop a project right from the idea stage- as we did on\\xa0made in dagenham, which was a radio program, or theatre pieces like little voice. it’s a very, very long process that can last up to five years. it has been wonderful having relationships with another company who are also hands-on creative producers, who know how to build finance, how to build a project creatively and see it right through to the end. those kind of projects can kind of pop in there while the other things are being developed from scratch.deadline: given your limited resources, how do you find yourselves able to compete against some of the bigger companies and even studios when they dip into the indie market. do you ever want to play in a bigger sandbox?ek– i find where i am\\xa0very exciting. we can’t be in the game of acquiring the\\xa0bestselling books. we can’t compete against the working titles. we don’t have that kind of financial access. but there is a wealth of material out there. it’s just identifying that thing you want to make. there are bestsellers, but sometimes they only last for a moment and a lot of stuff very quickly falls away and is forgotten. i’m interesting in finding material on the margin or\\xa0it will be things that people tried and couldn’t get off the ground. there’s examples of that all over. just look at the best exotic marigold hotel\\xa0, which was somewhere, didn’t get off the ground and then blueprint picked it up and it becomes what it becomes. we had that experience with carol,\\xa0where in many ways we were building it from scratch. it was something i had been\\xa0desperate to do but the rights weren’t free for so long. \\xa0i do find it exciting because you’re working in a world where everyone is focusing on what the thing is of the moment and then you go, well, actually there is this story over\\xa0here and no one has seen it\\xa0or maybe no one believed in it. but we’re going to pick this up and run with it.sw: the zeitgeist doesn’t need to dictate. that bestseller today is not necessarily going to be popular during the 2 years it takes to make the film. so often – and i think this is why hollywood often relies very much on remakes of old classics- \\xa0they recognise things sometimes are sustainable over a long period of time and never go away. it takes a while to develop and get a great script. it takes you a while to shoot it and to edit it and release it.\\xa0you can’t afford as filmmakers to make too many films that don’t make an impact. which is not to say that we’re aiming to outgrow avatar or become the next star wars.',\n",
       " 'ek: or deadpoolsw: deadpool is an interesting one . i like deadpool. what we can do is nurture ideas and originality and uniqueness and that’s something we try to do so that we aren’t falling into a groove\\xa0of making what everyone expects us to make. you look at the revenant, which had about 150 times the budget of carol,\\xa0or mad max, there is no chance in the world that we would produce necessarily either of those two films. \\xa0mad max is a franchise movie even if it’s winning lots of awards. we can’t be in the mad max business.\\xa0i’m not saying that in a limiting way.\\xa0\\xa0we’re in the david\\xa0business, not the goliath business. and actually that david business is a huge business and i think we realise that.ek: when you get it rightsw: – there is a huge audience there for unusual, unique, different types of movies. in britain we have always been able to mine that incredibly well.ek: i feel that because of the way that stephen and i work, i don’t think we will will be able to change. there is huge amounts of pride that come with making a film like carol and working with a filmmaker like todd haynes. as a producer to think that you have made something that will enter the canon of great films and will be written about for generations to come. because of the hands-on way we work even with the vod/ dvd release we’ll be there\\xa0working on the cover art- i think for us to do more than two\\xa0films a year would be very challenging because we won’t be exercising the same control and that nurturing presence. we’ve always said that we want to move into tv, for example, but we felt an organic move into tv is really the best way to go instead of setting up a structure/infrastructure and then try to fill that infrastructure with materials. we’ve always been talent and material driven so it feels as though establishing that tv arm should really come organically from either a spin-off project that we’ve done or talent that we’ve worked really close with who’s coming to us with an idea.sw: as for\\xa0the sandbox, i have no problems making big-budget films. i made interview with the vampire\\xa0with tom cruise and brad pitt. we’ve worked on big budget films with dreamworks, columbia, warner bros. i don’t have a problem with that at all. iithink it has to be the right kind of film, that’s all. it’s all well and good to do a studio deal but it has to be a studio deal that allows you to\\xa0bring to the project what can make it thrive. not simply a deal where you’re making films that they want you to make.',\n",
       " 'ek: one of the things we’re really proud of is building\\xa0some really seminal creative and financial relationships in this\\xa0industry. we’ve worked with hanway\\xa0on\\xa0five films, for example. some distributors, who share our passion for filmmaking and share the aesthetics and the sensibilities, and who have done well with us\\xa0are now coming to us and saying “do you want some development money?” that’s really beneficial because it takes away our whole anxiety level. developing a project is a long and sometimes tedious and flawed business. you’ve got to stick it out. you cannot\\xa0be frightened to make those changes to the script, for example. it’s very hard for us to develop something with the u.s.,\\xa0for example, because they’re 3000 or 5000 miles away and you don’t have that same kind of relationship that you can develop. we’ve\\xa0got some great relationships with\\xa0studio canal. we have another phyllis nagy script we’re working on with them now which will tie in well with universal\\xa0music group. those relationships are important to us. \\xa0you also have to try and get into a position where talent want to come to you. this year in particular has been a terrific one, because for such a tiny, tiny company, based in the uk, to have had the productions we’ve had with the co-producers and talent, it’s phenomenal. all we’re doing is putting our heads down and getting on with it because it’s a roller coaster ride.sw: we’d rather make one great movie where we’re sharing a few producers credit than 10 lousy movies where we’re getting all the credits and acclaim. we’re looking for great ideas and sometimes that’s not an easy life.ek: we wouldn’t be in this business if we weresw: we wouldn’t be making the kind of films we’re doing if we were looking for an easy life.deadline: is the focus on female driven stories intentional?sw: what we really found interesting about colette was it fits into what we’ve always been attracted to, namely the telling of a story that people think they know but from an angle which is\\xa0unique and original. that’s what we loved about the script. it was from a very modern perspective. it shares sensibilities with\\xa0what baz luhrmann did with his totally modern version of moulin rouge,\\xa0even\\xa0this is not a musical. it\\xa0transports\\xa0you into the eyes of colette as a modern woman, born out of time. you’re looking at a modern relationship but in the setting of what you’d consider to be archaic and old-fashioned. it’s\\xa0a story that shows you the past not only through today’s eyes but as though it is today. that’s why it is such a great script. t’s a similar thing we did with\\xa0backbeat\\xa0all those years ago about the beatles in hamburg. it was a\\xa0story that people didn’t know about and it also made john lennon a human being , not a god. it\\xa0told the story about when the beatles were just kids, and people loved that. they love humanising the past, rather than glorifying it.deadline: you’re reuniting with saoise ronan on on chesil beach after working together on byzantiumnominated for best actress, brooklyn',\n",

       " 'after years of waffling, we’re getting a dark tower movie. while not the most popular of stephen king’s stories (with almost sixty novels and over 200 short stories, it’d be like being the most popular beatles song or picasso painting), king’s epic fantasy magnum opus has a devout following. blending clint eastwood and lord of the rings-style fantasy adventure, the series is the dirty, desperate alternative to the typical arthurian retelling. at its core, the story follows roland deschain’s quest to find the dark tower and take revenge on the man in black, a novel-hopping sorcerer whose past includes roland’s mother and the destruction of his homeland. deschain is the last gunslinger (the revolver-twirling equivalent to a knight of the round table) trying to reach the dark tower, said to be the nexus of all universes, to restore order to his collapsing world. the series spans multiple dimensions, timelines, and reference material (at one point involving stephen king the real-world author as a character), charming readers with the sheer absurdity of its existence. this thing is almost too weird to exist in book form, let alone on the big screen.',\n",
       " 'and yet, here we are. what was once in the works as a javier bardem-led miniseries is now going to be a 2017 film directed by nikolaj arcel, who’s known for co-writing the swedish the girl with the dragon tattoo and directing a royal affair (18th century romantic drama), king’s game (government conspiracy flick), and island of lost souls (crazy fantasy featuring possession and necromancers). if those credits don’t inspire faith, know that veteran writers anders thomas jensen, akiva goldsman, and jeff pinkner all have a hand in the script. sure, the last thing pinkner and goldsman put out was the abysmal ya-adaptation the 5th wave, but let’s just hope that was a source material problem.that said, we already know the writers aren’t shy about straying from the books. they’ve already cast mad max: fury road’s abbey lee as the female lead tirana, who isn’t a lead at all in the books, but rather an extremely minor henchman in a group called the regulators. she may be spinning a character named susannah (a dissociative double-amputee) in a new direction, swapping her race to keep racial tension (an important book component) alive between herself and idris elba’s roland. perfectly charismatic, elba’s wordless, macho strength finds its way into most of his roles, from luther to beasts of no nation, but his sly charm (see prometheus) will add proper depth to the nomadic lead.meanwhile, on the other side of morality, matthew mcconaughey‘s the man in black – a constantly shifting devil with tons of aliases – is an ageless deceiver and generally sleazy guy. when casting the same role for the tv adaptation of the stand (novel-hopping, remember?), stephen king said he wanted someone who “would make the ladies’ hearts go pitty pat, that looked like the type of guy you would see on the cover of one of those sweet, savage love paperback romances”. mcconaughey’s transformed from rom-com slacker to stripper to aids victim to lincoln spokesman, showing off a slippery versatility perfect for a trickster. ',\n",
       " 'as for the other two members of roland’s group, we can only speculate. while eddie, a drug mule who functions as a narrative instrument for king’s own battle with drug abuse, could be anyone, i’d love to see buzzard’s joshua burge bring his abrasive desperation to the role. when considering eleven-year-old jake, the stable, reserved surrogate son of roland, there’s nobody better than jacob tremblay. just imagine that kid with a pair of pistols.',\n",
       " 'as to what material the movie will cover, arcel is vague on the details, saying it’ll skip the beginning, and heavily involve our non-fantasy world. entertainment weekly has wisely speculated that the film could be adapting the waste lands, the third book, in order to incorporate the group elements of a harry potter or lord of the rings. the waste lands, skipping over much of the lone-desert-wanderer material that might not play with popular audiences, finds roland completing his ka-tet, or crew, by pulling jake from new york city. then his party, which in the novel consists of eddie, susannah, jake, and oy the billy-bumbler (like a raccoon dog with parrot-like speech ability), follows an effective yellow brick road to the tower. i’m thinking they’ll also grab material from the end of the first book, the gunslinger, whose opening “the man in black fled across the desert, and the gunslinger followed” served as an accompaniment to the casting announcement of elba and mcconaughey, and the second, the drawing of three. some combination of these books would cover the coalescence of the main characters a la the fellowship of the ring, and allow us to jump right into the mythology without flashbacks or lone character wandering.if you want to prep yourself for this certainly epic film, you’ve got until january 13, 2017 to read up and create\\xa0fan theories of your own. it might just be enough time to get through the eight monstrous books and find out there’s a crazy talking train that tells the ka-tet riddles. so, to sum up: a fellowship made up of a junkie, a gunslinger, a new york kid, and a legless woman follow the path of their destinies to a magical tower which is the center of all realities, combining fantasy, sci-fi, and western genres along the way. also, an evil talking train. see you in a year.',\n",

they’re woven into the very fabric of the film’s style. take, for example, the film’s second shot, which depicts the arrival of our heroine (krisha fairchild): in a single, winding take, she crosses the driveways and manicured lawns of a suburban neighborhood, muttering nervously to herself until she finds the right house. shults doesn’t even cut when krisha is finally ushered inside and greeted one at a time by the family. he just sits on the moment, basking in the discomfort. unfolding across an especially long and awkward thanksgiving day, \"krisha\" creates an audio-visual language of social anxiety; it’s practically a horror movie about the horror of being the unwanted guest at the party. almost every stylistic choice—most of them quite dynamic, especially for a first-time director—has been made to serve krisha’s subjective perspective, her “jumpiness.” rhythmic montages of activity, scored to the atonal plucks of brian mcomber’s sinister score, somehow turn the mundane activities of a holiday get-together—preparing the meal; watching the big game; horsing around in the yard—into sources of unease. these are private family rituals, not for interlopers. likewise, several conversations are shot from eavesdropping distance, the camera creeping down hallways or lingering in doorways. \"krisha\" keeps krisha always on the outside, unable to participate. read more.justin chang, varietykrisha is greeted warmly enough (perhaps a bit too warmly), and she reciprocates with an eagerness to make herself useful, putting herself to work in the kitchen while robyn heads out to fetch their wheelchair-bound mother (billie fairchild, shults\\' grandmother). as krisha sets about gutting the turkey, shults whips the character’s movements into a montage of high anxiety, his swift edits keeping time with the chop-chop-chop of the knife and the percolating rhythms of brian mcomber\\'s score. by the time the music fades, the cutting slows and the mood relaxes, it\\'s clear that \"krisha\" means to reveal its protagonist\\'s perspective not through exposition, but in the very texture of the filmmaking — varying its syntax so as to draw us ever deeper into one woman’s profound sense of alienation from those around her. shults\\'s approach craftily favors observation over exposition, and he proves as attentive to krisha\\'s surroundings as he is to her inner life; we\\'re made continually aware of the teenagers laughing and goofing off in the background, along with the numerous dogs roaming the property, all of them enjoying the day with enviably carefree abandon. meanwhile, old resentments spark between krisha and an ornery, outspoken relative, doyle (a hilarious bill wise), in a long, varied and remarkably improvised conversation that unfolds loosely throughout the film\\'s first half. but perhaps her most awkward and telling interaction occurs with trey (shults), a quiet young college student whom she approaches with the insistent warmth of an old friend, yet who obviously wants nothing to do with her. read more.jordan hoffman, the guardianthere are no shortage of movies about self-destructive behavior, but what sets krisha apart is krisha herself. nothing against him, but if this movie starred the very talented john hawkes it would already be one step toward old hat. we\\'ve seen that story before. to cast an older woman with an un-hollywood body type is itself something of a revolutionary act. her performance matched with shults’ unique shooting and editing make this winner of the 2015 south by southwest grand jury prize one of the essential independent films of the year. that it likely also doubles as therapy for the entire shults family is a happy residual for them. read more.',\n",

       " \"notebook: eldorado xxi premiered at the berlin international film festival's forum. is that something you looked forward to?salomé lamas: we did discuss with the producers where we would pitch the film. within the big carnival that film festivals usually are, the forum is open to serious work and treats it accordingly. it's a carefully curated section, with a rigor that transcends the mere sidebar within a big festival, and that makes me very comfortable. i feel happy being in the forum, it's the right place for the way the film turned out, within a family of filmmakers that makes sense to me.notebook: the forum makes a point of looking beyond cinema, into the connections with modern visual and multimedia arts. that's something you do as well, switching between installation work and more traditional film. how do you decide what is the correct form for each project?lamas: in the specific case of eldorado xxi, the original idea was to make a kind of hybrid documentary, with a loose script and characters. but then it moved in other directions. the long shot at the beginning of the film happened because i was thinking of doing a parallel museum piece, but when i came back from la rinconada i realized that particular shot could very well be a part of the film. from that moment on, i wouldn't use it in a museum piece so as not to cannibalize my work, and that led the film into a more radical, less classical side. that was due in part to my own way of structuring and approaching the picture, but also because we shot in such a difficult place. it was a really troublesome shoot, nightmarish almost. but back to your question, my studies were originally in cinema and it was only later i did my masters in art, so the installations and gallery work are a more recent development. probably, though, everything i've ever done has always had that possibility to be presented in either of those venues. some projects demand a more consistent financing and lead to different results. it's different to go to la rinconada on your own than to go to la rinconada with a team after two years waiting for the funding to come. i'm always doing many different projects at the same time. this year i'll spend a month in the jungles of borneo, and i have another project i want to shoot in the middle east, between cairo, dubai and beyrouth. smaller projects that i fund in other ways, but that are necessary to me. not just for artistic reasons but also so i can have a life like everybody else and a job like everyone else. it's really a way to live your daily life.notebook: shooting in the peruvian andes is a weird way to live your daily life…lamas: but there is a practical side to it. i don't have a romantic vision of filmmaking, i find creativity and talent meaningless words. i'm closer to being a cobbler, working on a craft you have to master in order to improve. it's all about experiences, and storing experiences, and that makes you look differently at everything. i find it utterly condemnable that some directors shoot abroad in a very gratuitous way: there's not enough drama in the northern hemisphere or in the place they live in, so they go elsewhere in the world to look for it. those films are very easy to spot, they're much closer to the militant, campaigning documentary, which doesn't really stimulate me as a viewer. i find lots of ethical problems in them. so, on one hand, it's all about managing your daily life, and on the other it's about that storing of experiences and your ability to live anywhere, about understanding how other places you can live in interfere with you and you with them. that's where most of the\\xa0 ideas probably present in all my work come from. the sense of waiting, of finding something surprising to me that i may find interesting to record; of me being an alien in a different reality, and how the friction that creates can generate a project, a desire to bring to the forefront realities unknown or forgotten.notebook: but a craftsman usually sits at his table, while you travel around the world...lamas: that's related to a certain mental confusion, and to my sense of hyper-activity [laughs]. i like paradoxes, i like conflict, though i don't deal at all well with conflict. i don't like to shoot, so i put myself in situations i can't later run away from. sometimes you need to have some luck for it to work out fine; you have to be on the lookout for something, wait for it to happen, whether premeditated or unexpected. but it's also connected with the inability to separate life from work, and with my need to do several projects at the same time. i may be shooting something in a particular corner of the world and then i come across something that links to something else, so i make a note and save it for a future project. you can't just turn off your brain and say, i'm compartmentalizing this. everything happens constantly at the same time. notebook: do you find people have a different perception of your work depending on where they come across it first, in the theatre or in the museum?lamas: i don't think so, but it is difficult for me to say because i'm the artist. that's something that comes more from critics, or curators, or even the institutions… it's never something i'm worried about. also, when you are trying to invoke a lineage, that means you're not really interested in the work but in something else. i'm attracted by a series of things related to the ends of the earth, exiled places, margins; i'm always seeking the limits of the forms themselves, whether of non-fiction cinema or of presentation, showing the same work in different contexts. i don't think that theoretical reflection is what gets the films going, though. that comes from a more... kamikaze side of me, slightly irresponsible, though actually very pragmatic. i'm very aware of the risks i'm taking, which are always measured even when i'm pushing physical or geographical limits. notebook: why do you feel attracted toward those limits?lamas: i think initially out of curiosity towards people, towards all that's around me, and also with the idea of how to translate reality into a filmic language. notebook: your work invites the audience to experience the journey with you, and not just respond passively.\\xa0 lamas: oh, absolutely, i don't like lazy people. [laughs] i'm interested in how the perception of the audience changes. i like to push the limits of the audience, whether of appreciation or of understanding. i never liked going to a museum and seeing interactive pieces because they're usually accompanied by instructions on how to interact. i'm more interested in active viewers, and leave others to judge and reflect. essentially, i ask questions, and questions bigger than myself, and bigger than the audience. there's also something else: a question always has an answer. however, that answer isn't always in the film, or if it is it's hidden in a little box, and it's up to the audience to find it. notebook: in shooting in la rinconada, i'm reminded of werner herzog. but his work has a more spontaneous, personal side, while yours is more distanced, very thought through.lamas: i'd love to meet herzog! but i don't know what his spectrum of enthusiasm is. it probably bleeds into the films. i tend to play with the entire spectrum of what enthusiasm or emotion is, but because of the way i tend to look at things, the films look like they're very controlled. that's another paradox. i'm always looking to let go of control, but i need to have a measure of control. i don't know if both things can coexist, but i feel they do anyway... just because you don't see me jumping for joy, it doesn't mean i don't feel it, i just don't show it outwardly...notebook: you keep saying you don't like shooting. do you take more pleasure in editing?lamas: i suppose so. or maybe that's the way i found to live in the world. [laughs] i'm always moved by the pleasure of watching, not so much by sharing my way of watching. i take enormous pleasure in watching, but that's never enough. that's why you're always looking for extremes, because it's never enough to just film reality.notebook: you make it sound like an addiction...lamas: yes, maybe. but that's also got to do with obsession. you're always trying to go further while knowing full well you'll never go far enough. so it's that thing of the journey rather than the destination being the thing. what matters is that i went to la rinconada and spent time with those people. and that shapes the film, because the end result is always unpredictable. beforehand, all i can say is, i'm going to go there and bring a film back. now the film i bring back can be a, or b, or c… notebook: ...but you don't really know until you come back.lamas: precisely. because very often i haven't even scouted locations, i just get there and set up the camera and shoot in the moment, though that wasn't the case in eldorado xxi.notebook: do you recognize a through line that connects all your films? like a worldview of your own?lamas: more than i used to, because i'm constantly asked to inscribe myself in a circle or in a world. also, i can look at my work in other ways after doing q&a sessions with audiences, or reading or talking with other people after the film is done. i have a lot of fun developing a project on paper, trying to imagine all the possible outcomes of a reality i don't fully know, and all i can do with it. it's a theoretical construct. then i go out and shoot, knowing full well i'm playing with expectations, not all of which will come true. there's a more emotive, intuitive side to it; you need to react because you don't always have time to think. you need to be there in the moment, aware. then, when i return home with the material, i can certainly go back to the theory, but that can be dangerous, because theories don't always work in practice. for the editing to work, i find i need to carry over that intuition, that emotional side from the shoot, while needing a structure. you have to accommodate the film so it becomes a film but then, once it's finished and you're free of it, it becomes something else, it's no longer yours. also, working with the right people can enrich the film vastly. they will open doors for you and allow you to explore territories you'd be reluctant to explore on your own. a dialogue may allow you to make a suggestion and somebody else will take it to the next level and you'll be thankful they did – that happened in eldorado xxi with the sound work. you don't always have to have the most brilliant technicians in the world, you just need the right people to understand what you're doing as a person. when the film is done, and it starts being seen and read by the world, then you can go back to the theory, and start thinking how to speak about the film, how to put on paper what happened by impulse. this is one reason why i have a hard time communicating with people during a shoot...\",\n",

       " '            emboldened public figures, using sharper tactics, may be able to get their cutting-edge privacy disputes to juries not willing to give the american media any breaks.        a mysterious package arrives at the newsroom. when opened, it\\'s clear this is sensational stuff. the material gets published. readers flock. and yet, what\\'s put online is called a massive invasion of privacy. a legal missive demands an end to publishing secrets. but it\\'s deemed newsworthy. and the first amendment protects that, right?no, not the hulk hogan sex tape. we\\'re talking about documents purloined from the sony hack in november 2014. no, not gawker. well, gawker published hacked information too, but in this instance we\\'re referring to the wall street journal, bloomberg, the hollywood reporter — pretty much every news outlet in the country.a florida jury\\'s $115 million verdict against gawker on friday — with punitive damages still to be assessed — compels an examination into what sort of precedent this sets. for decades, thanks to favorable legal decisions such as new york times v. sullivan (concerning libel of public figures), new york times v. united states (the right to publish classified information) and bartnicki v. vopper (the right to broadcast illegally recorded communications), media outlets have operated with an air of confidence on materials determined to be in the public interest. should the press now be concerned about what went down in a florida courtroom at hulk hogan\\'s trial?many first amendment scholars will point out that this was merely a trial verdict, one that might not survive gawker\\'s promised appellate review. the hogan case is also, in the words of george freeman, the executive director of the media law resource center, one that addresses \"an unusual and extremely private matter.\" that is, a sex tape.then again, as seen by the sony hack, news organizations confront all types of objections on privacy grounds. in the digital age, with drones in the sky and biometric-collecting devices on the ground, the issue of ensuring privacy for citizens will surely cause lawmakers and courts to grapple with the boundaries of free speech. during the hogan trial, a gawker editor was asked about attitudes on \"revenge porn.\" but the tough issues surely go beyond nudity and sex. for example, just a month ago, nfl superstar jason pierre-paul filed an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit in a florida court against espn and its reporter adam\\xa0schefter after a photo of his medical records was tweeted out to 4 million followers.\\xa0will news of hogan\\'s victory embolden potential plaintiffs?\"when you see a number like $115 million, sure, it can\\'t help but be an optimistic sign for plaintiffs,\" freeman tells thr. \"will it lead to similar cases? the answer is probably yes.\"when celebrities and others do sue, the hogan case may provide another signal of what\\'s to come. while the verdict itself is of limited legal precedent, the nearly-forgotten story of how — and where — it got to trial in the first place provides some.\\xa0when hogan first sued, he did so in federal court by attaching a copyright claim. thanks to hogan\\'s settlement agreement with bubba the love sponge, the plaintiff was conferred rights to the sex tape in question. the federal judge, when asked to rule on a temporary restraining order against gawker, signaled hogan\\'s uphill battle with word that the publishing of the video excerpt was \"in conjunction with the news reporting function\" and that the \"factual finding supports a colorable fair use defense.\"hogan then switched tactics, making the case more about privacy than property. he re-filed in state court without the federal copyright claim. gawker then had the case removed back to federal court. but the judge there noted the presence as a co-defendant of heather cole (formerly clem) — hogan\\'s sex partner in the tape — \\xa0and decided that diversity jurisdiction (and thus a federal court) didn\\'t apply. and so the case was remanded back to a state court.why this became important is that it allowed hogan to fight with a home-field advantage, before a judge, the pinellas circuit\\'s pamela campbell, who was appointed to the bench in 2006 by governor jeb bush after proving her conservative bona fides\\xa0by representing the parents of terri schiavo in a end-of-life case that received national attention. it\\'s also possibly significant that circuit judges in florida go through elections. in the middle of the hogan litigation, she was re-elected to a six-year term in 2014. studies show that elections can shape decisions made from the bench. campbell has obviously received a great deal of publicity from this hogan case.before trial, judge campbell was asked to make all sorts of rulings — including determining what evidence was irrelevant and potentially prejudicial. she also had to tackle gawker\\'s summary judgment motions to decide whether hogan\\'s claims should even be tried before a jury. it\\'s easy to fault her for a series of decisions strongly in favor of hogan, but then again, there\\'s never been a celebrity sex tape trial before. also, first amendment boundaries aren\\'t particularly clear-cut on statutes like right of publicity, one of the claims that hogan was pursuing.once the case got to trial, and gawker met a state court jury, hogan was able to exploit the overwhelming unpopularity of the news media to his advantage. \"do you think the media can do whatever they want?\" asked hogan\\'s attorney ken turkel in closing arguments.it\\'s true that the public has long been skeptical about the trustworthiness and fairness of the media. public surveys show that the unfavorable rating continues to sink. according to gallup, just 40 percent of americans have a \"great deal\" or a \"fair amount\" of confidence in the media. that\\'s down from 55 percent at the turn of the century. the rise of web-based media and no-holds-barred sites like gawker certainly hasn\\'t helped that perception. the opinion of the media has ebbed so low that donald trump has made the need to reshape libel laws an agenda item in his bid for presidency. just days before the verdict, republican citizens of florida overwhelmingly voted to support him.what this all adds up to is the prospect of more privacy lawsuits against media defendants in state court before judges who might not be so friendly and before juries who might not be so protective of the rights of reporters and editors to make their newsworthy calls. even if trump never becomes president, lawmakers will also be deciding whether to enact legislation to stop frivolous lawsuits targeting speech and save defendants from enduring expensive, harassing litigation.of course, many lawyers and scholars such as uc irvine\\xa0law school dean\\xa0erwin chemerinsky, believe the only bright line established in the hogan case pertains to sex tapes, and that gawker has a good shot on appeal. the potential psychological fallout from the verdict in newsrooms faced with tough decisions about whether to publish privacy-invasive material presents a different analysis.\"will there be a chilling effect on journalists?\" asks chemerinksy. \"i\\xa0hope not. i guess editors will have to address that.\"',\n",

       " \"it shouldn't be too surprising that if you have two kinds of regular tv viewers out in the real world — those who give up on shows immediately if the hook isn't set and those who watch every episode no matter what — the same might apply to those of us who are professional tv critics. that said, critics might have a different set of criteria for continuing or not. it's the peak tv era after all and some of us believe there's too much television.beyond quitting a series or not, there are other fundamental quandaries that both regular tv viewers and critics alike face all the time in the gray-area world of our changing television landscape. thr tv critics tim goodman and daniel fienberg knocked around some ideas, thoughts and theories on the subject:tim goodman: please tell me you stopped watching heartbeat after your pretty savage review of it. because if you didn't, we might not be able to have this conversation.daniel fienberg: i have a hard-and-fast policy that if i'm reviewing a show, i'll watch as many episodes as the networks give me, and often that ends up being a masochistic gesture. so i watched three episodes of heartbeat and that will be it for me. i didn't need to watch fuller house beyond the six episodes netflix made available, and if netflix hadn't made the entire eight-episode run of flaked available, i could have stopped, but instead i watched all of it. but i don't have the same policy regarding continuing to watch after screeners if i think that what i've seen seems to be representative of the show's potential — and if there are no points of genuine curiosity, i don't need to watch more. when it comes to heartbeat, i've seen what i need to see and i needn't see any more.on the other hand, the catch, which also premieres this week, had a bad pilot, but it was a bad pilot that suggested potential for a lot of creative redevelopment and reconception. abc only made one episode available, but i will watch another couple of episodes, just because i don't feel like i've seen the show and i want to see what it settles into. will you be checking back in on the catch? is my policy hopelessly naive and time-absorbing?\",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'goodman: well, i won\\'t comment on \"naive\" but it\\'s definitely \"time-absorbing\" and, perhaps, masochistic. i have no such rule. i do loathe when networks only send one episode because pilots are problematic. that said, i can\\'t help broadcast television stop killing itself slowly. and the time i invested in the catch will never come back. besides 1) why would anyone watch after that? 2) while i do love some network shows as pure escapism — nbc\\'s the blacklist, cbs\\' elementary and person of interest — the shondaland stuff is really not for me. and while i admire your, ahem, insane devotion to watching everything you\\'re sent, pre-review, i find there\\'s never an exact number of episodes that it takes for me to form the opinion i then take into the review. for example, i\\'ve seen shows so heinous i can\\'t make it through the pilot. that\\'s my \"i don\\'t have to put my hand in the fire to know it\\'ll burn me\" rule. other times, i may have six episodes and know by the fourth that i love it and i\\'m ready to write. because of deadlines or life, i may not have time to watch the other two when i need to file and move on.but this brings up a couple of issues that we should probably address. first, i\\'m not sure most people, outside of critics, would watch four episodes of a show they don\\'t like just to get to the turning point that makes it good — or even great. it\\'s my firmly held belief that time is the most precious commodity for regular working folks, and in some way part of our job, in this too much television world, is kind of a psa on how not to waste time on crap. of course, i\\'ve seen plenty of shows that really do get great after four episodes. you might have some in mind? i wonder, though, if those shows (those creators, those channels, etc.) have the luxury in this competitive environment to become great that late.fienberg: i don\\'t think people have time to watch crap, but i do think that even more than professional viewers do, audiences latch on to a thing or two that they love and that makes the show, more than if the show itself becomes empirically \"good.\" i\\'m a firm believer that nearly every show has a \"best\" version of itself and a \"worst\" version, and if i can see the best version peeking around the corner, i\\'ll wait for it. and wait for it. and wait for it. it took me two full seasons to give up on the blacklist ever becoming more than a james spader showcase and then to decide i\\'d seen him do his thing enough, so i could quit. i\\'m happy i\\'ve stuck with limitless this season, because even if its best self is just a fun procedural with occasional inspiration, i like that. whereas i keep watching quantico and blindspot for no discernible reason. you liked both of those two more than i did in the fall, but have i outlasted you?sometimes it just takes a few episodes to get into the rhythm of a show, whether it\\'s me not quite grooving on it or the creators not settling into the groove immediately. baskets has gone from a show i found odd to a show whose oddness i embraced to a show that, as its ending its first season, i actually love. you reviewed and didn\\'t like baskets when it premiered. have you stuck with it? what does it take to get you to revisit a you\\'re the worst or a happy valley?goodman: i kept with quantico and blindspot (more the latter) until it was clear they were just going to be mysteries with never-answered questions and, worse, stupid in the process. this from the guy who still watches the blacklist. but spader can make up for a lot — i guess that\\'s my latch-on point. and while we can\\'t paint all viewers with the same brush, the feedback i get from lots of people is 1) they are incredibly overwhelmed with choices and just want a handful of new things they can get into (they want the best of the best, so i\\'m always aware of that and never recommend series still trying to find themselves) and 2) having not much \"free\" time in their lives to invest in a show, a lot of people i know opt out of certain series, even excellent ones like the americans, if they don\\'t immediately get into it.anyway, that last point of yours is interesting. i liked some of the quirk on baskets (mainly louie anderson) but found it both unfunny and the main character, played by zach galifianakis, was relentlessly unlikable. a show like that — and i watched four episodes — makes it a very long shot that i give it another chance. and i\\'m not seeing the passionate, sustained support for it that was popping up in the ether (or my twitter feed) like there was for you\\'re the worst. and in fairness, i only saw two episodes of you\\'re the worst and kind of liked the second — going back to revisit revealed i clearly made a mistake in my quick judgment. same for happy valley — one and a half episodes, i think, as i was sampling to see if i should review the first season. i was really busy and passed on it because it didn\\'t strike me as fresh or different. clearly that was more of a pop-in-and-see, flash decision situation, and i\\'m truly happy i went back.are there series you\\'d do that with? i was going to give daredevil another chance because people said it got better in the first season — but i saw lots of bad reaction to the deeper episodes of season two, and i\\'m glad i skipped. in this hectic environment, i think that\\'s time saved. looking back, another series i didn\\'t have to review and thus shunted to the side was sense8, which i revisited and really unexpectedly enjoyed.fienberg: baskets was always going to be an acquired taste, and i\\'m not surprised it hasn\\'t caught on like you\\'re the worst, which is a much more accessible show. personally, i think baskets is much better than the first you\\'re the worst season, but you needn\\'t revisit, because there\\'s nothing worse than people getting cult-y about a show and then you revisit it with higher expectations that can\\'t be attained.take something like the 100. the first five or six episodes are genuinely awful, but enough people insisted it got better that i revisited and you know what? it did get better. but even while acknowledging and knowing that it wasn\\'t the inept show that premiered, i wasn\\'t coming close to feeling the passion that fans were feeling, and i petered out midway through the second season because there was something it just wasn\\'t doing for me. i\\'m grumpy enough as is and i don\\'t need to watch a show that i\\'m a 5 or 6 on, hoping it\\'ll become a 10 for me. of course, there are a lot of shows that i\\'m a 3 or 4 on that i still watch.someday i want to go back and watch spartacus from the point that people insist it got good, even though those opening episodes were so bad. but there are a bunch of shows that i liked much more, but never finished or caught up on. you mentioned sense8 and that\\'s one where i got to halfway through the first season, but never finished. it\\'s a much better show than nashville or the walking dead, but i\\'m caught up on those.does comedy versus drama make a difference in terms of how quickly or slowly you give up?',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " 'goodman: let me save you some time with spartacus — it never got better. it was and remains homoerotic blood porn, badly written and, for the most part, acted. the 100, however, is a great example of what it takes (and whether it\\'s worth it) to go back and \"discover\" shows you might have passed on. based on the hoopla, i did go back and just like you suffered through the early half of season one (most people should just watch the pilot and skip deep into the first season somewhere), only to like where it was going and watch it become something much better in the second season and early third season. i say early third season because even though the show is probably at its best right now, i haven\\'t kept up because, all together now: there\\'s too much television.so, was it worth it? as a critic, sure, just to be able to tell people a really bad show became pretty damned good. i\\'d say it\\'s more a 7 on your scale, but even then is that a show i\\'d tip people with time constraints toward rather than, say, the americans or 20-plus other series? probably not. but again, i doubt that superfans of the 100 will take my advice and watch happy valley. i ended up liking sense8 because, visually, there\\'s really nothing like it. plus, it\\'s bold and felt different — i\\'ll take that combo. in comparison, another netflix show, bloodline, was harder to endorse because, well, it takes forever to go beyond good and become interesting. still like it, but not my first — or 15th— recommendation to people.i can\\'t remember if you loathe the saying \"comedy is subjective\" or not, but i\\'m fine with using it and believe it. i just couldn\\'t get some people to like or laugh along to arrested development, which is hall of fame first ballot; i\\'m not sure i can even be around people who don\\'t like that (or 30 rock). i\\'ll sample comedies frequently but will also bail earlier because i know almost immediately whether i\\'ll like it or not. i\\'m not a fan of shows i know you like, such as mom or big bang theory, but you\\'ve convinced me to start watching the carmichael show and i think we\\'re both constantly touting stuff like fresh off the boat and black-ish. but i think quantity fatigue also sets in for comedies, right? i really like broad city but sometimes just can\\'t get motivated. i mean, the dvr stacks up with tons of stuff, and veep and silicon valley, two shows i wouldn\\'t miss on the night they air, haven\\'t even started yet. same with archer. and i need to catch up on sunny. lots of excellent stuff out there, but so, so much of it.fienberg: i don\\'t think i ever told anybody i like big bang theory. i don\\'t dislike it, either. in fact, i almost never give positive or negative reactions to it, though i\\'ve become increasingly sick of the show\\'s inability to do anything that isn\\'t stereotypical with raj, even after 200 episodes. big bang theory is one of seemingly dozens of half-hours that i record and watch each week because a 20-minute network comedy requires precious little effort to have on in the background, even if i\\'m waiting for a great cast to overcome mediocre writing, like with life in pieces, or waiting for a once-great show to reach its end, like with modern family, or all those years i watched how i met your mother even when it was one of the worst shows on tv. so i\\'m actually never behind by more than an episode or two on any of my comedies, even if i have 10+ episodes of the vampire diaries piling up on my dvr.and then there\\'s all the reality stuff i still watch, mostly survivor, the amazing race, top chef and the dying gasps of american idol, stuff i stick with even through bad seasons, though i think i\\'ve quit two or three reality shows in the past few years. and you don\\'t have any of those, do you?and don\\'t knock homoerotic blood porn. we both spend a fair amount of time watching sports.so is the lesson of this conversation: \"tim quits things, dan doesn\\'t, but neither is a path to bliss, at least if you trust our twitter feeds\"?goodman: i think we maybe just proved there is no right way to go about it, but there\\'s a lot of opportunity to waste a big chunk of your life in this new tv landscape. all we can do is tell people to choose wisely by pointing out what\\'s worth their time. after that, anything that we don\\'t agree with can be used for mocking on twitter, yes. or maybe we just point to the hourglass of their lives and shake our heads knowingly. meanwhile, i think we just got ourselves way behind on some shows.',\n",

       " 'historical drama series underground premiered to a ratings record for wgn last month, and for creators misha green and joe pokaski, it feels amazing. “people were afraid of the idea of coming back to slavery week after week,” explains green, and the resulting numbers can only be viewed as a vindication. “from the beginning, we said it was a thriller,” she added. “it could be exciting, it could be deep, and that’s the tv that i love.”',\n",
       " 'underground is the result of a laborious research process on the part of the show’s creators, who went deep into the archives to find the truth surrounding the underground railroad, and the lives of those slaves who used it to escape to freedom in the 19th century. both pokaski and green recognized this as a story that hadn’t been properly depicted, on television or in entertainment generally, and that part of the reason for this is that the true stories of the slaves in this time are, for the most part, hidden. indeed, these aren’t stories you necessarily read about in history books, but are rather buried within libraries and archives.“we found these library of congress narratives of people who were actually there. it was a treasure trove if you knew where to look,” says pokaski. as the amount of stories expanded, the cast did as well, though the strategy and the mission remained the same. what you want is every character to be complicated, to surprise you when you’re writing and when you’re watching,” says green, who noted that even the show’s slave owner roles were dimensionalized and given great thought.not content with taking the easy way out or settling for the simplest answer, the creators of underground set out to be bold with not only their visual and story-telling choices, but their choice of music as well. though the creators took few liberties with the narrative of the underground railroad, there is one admitted exception to that. “kanye (west) was not in 1857,” jokes green. in their contemporary score, the creators found a new avenue into creating a necessary sense of urgency around the material.indeed, to green and pokaski, the show could not possibly be more resonant and relevant in today’s world of political and social upheaval — in which racism remains a reality. “we were looking at papers describing why slavery had to exist for the economy, and you could remove certain words and it would be about the minimum wage being raised,” said pokaski, addressing parallels to current economic issues in america. in a world in need of great reform, green was inspired by the ability and determination of those slaves escaping on the underground railroad, and those helping them along the way to change the course of history. “we talk about ‘how active is your activism?’ – with these people, the odds were against them, but they were moving the needle of history,” she says. “i think we’re telling part of a struggle that’s still going on,” adds pokaski. “and that’s important.”',\n",

       " 'admitting that it “failed” in its original attempt in january to devise a “one size fits all rule” regarding the voting rights of its members, the board of governors of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences has sent a new letter to its members clarifying how voting status will be determined and leaving it up to the organization’s 17 branches to devise their own particular rules for their members.acknowledging “some anger and frustration” on the part of members who feared losing their voting status because they had retired or who felt they were being accused of racial bias in their choice of oscar nominees, the letter seeks to reassure the membership by stating, “if you have spent a lifetime in motion pictures, you will not lose your vote.” it further emphasizes, “you will not lose your voting privileges simply because you’re retired or haven’t been active for a while. there is nothing ageist about this. in fact, these new guidelines advantage those with longer careers over shorter careers.”the letter then lays out in detail a process for determining voting eligibility that it says is “fair, inclusive and transparent.”the academy will use what it calls “activity” in the film business as its first criterion in determining voting rights. but it is now explicitly setting out how that “activity” will be determined. this year’s new members, the letter explains, will be given an automatic right to vote for 10 years, but the clock starts ticking on that 10-year term not when the member is admitted, but from an earlier period when the member completed what it calls “first qualifying work.” since many members often have a significant body of work by the time they’re invited to join the academy, by linking voting eligibility to earlier work, the academy will be giving members credit for previous years’ activity in the business.',\n",

       " 'a member who has been active during his or her first 10-year term will have voting rights renewed for a second 10-year term, and if they remain active during that term, their voting rights will be renewed for a third 10-year term, and if they’re active during that term, they will be vested with lifetime voting rights. the academy said the three 10-year terms don’t have to be consecutive, but that alternatively a member could secure lifetime voting\\xa0rights in as few as 21 years after a “first qualifying work.”in order to apply the new rules retroactively to existing members, the board said, it will rely on each of its branches to decide what counts as an individual member’s “first qualifying work.” “the idea here,” the letter said, “is to specifically design the criteria so they’re fair and inclusive to each branch.\"for example, it notes since production designers often do not earn their first production designer credit until well into their careers, the designers branch could choose a different point in a designer\\'s career as a \"first qualifying work.\"similarly, it acknowledges that producers, writers and others can work for years without earning screen credits, “so those branches will come up with their own definitions, based on employment and not screen credit, to make sure that people who remained active for a full career don’t lose their vote.”and, as previously stated, members who receive an oscar nomination will automatically earn lifetime voting rights.according to the letter, the academy’s bylaws have not guaranteed lifetime voting rights since the academy underwent an earlier review of its membership in 1970. but the new rules will guaranteed lifetime voting for those who qualify under the rules.the letter concluded by saying the new rules about voting rights are not part of its ongoing diversity initiative. “this initiative, required by our bylaws, has to do with relevance,” the board said before concluding, “adhering to our existing bylaws in this regard is our best assurance that we will continue to retain the crucial relevance of our awards, and continue to maintain the academy’s standard of excellence.”',\n",

(the three ten-year terms do not have to be consecutive, and if you do the math, you\\'ll see that the requirement can be met in as little as 21 years from \"first qualifying work.\") in addition, if they ever receive an oscar nomination, they will be vested with lifetime voting privileges. that\\'s how new members will be treated from this year on. now, here\\'s how we\\'ll apply these very inclusive standards to current members.',\n",

       " 'our monthly film club is in session.i am a film critic, but almost all of the movies i watch are new releases. that is going to change. with jeff bayer’s remedial film school a notable film critic or personality will assign me (and you) one film per month. comedian doug benson from the podcast doug loves movies is our guest, and he chose used cars (available for rent on itunes, google play, and amazon). each section begins with a quote from the film.benson explains: i don’t like recommending movies to people. i don’t like being told that i was wrong. about my opinion. so now i say things like, “i like it, you might too.” or, like in the case of batman v superman: dawn of justice, i say “i hated it, but you should check it out if you think you might like it.” so when the proprietor\\u200a—\\u200ais that the right word?\\u200a—\\u200aof this column asked me to pick a great film that he hasn’t seen, my very first thought was used cars. it’s a movie that is most certainly not everyone’s cup of proverbial tea, but man do i love it.the star of used cars, kurt russell, is one of my favorite actors. i’ve been a fan back to his disney days, when he was a tennis shoe wearing computer, or the subject of strength and invisibility experiments, but in his overall film career, i’d say he’s in only one truly great comedy. before you come at me with the likes of captain ron or overboard, i’d argue that dramas like the hateful eight and bone tomahawk were more amusing. what i love about russell’s performance in used cars is that he accomplishes the nearly impossible feat of making a sleazy used car salesman likable. a used car salesman who wants to be a politician, even. how can this happen? well, not only is russell’s rudy russo a charmer, but the owner of the mega car lot across the street is a much bigger a-hole. as played by the late great jack warden, he’s a thoroughly over the top villain. that the same actor plays his sweet and low-key twin brother just adds to the fun.i should also mention that used cars is raunchy as hell. it’s dirtier than anything else from acclaimed director robert zemeckis, but includes the complex plotting and fast pace of the back to the future films (i know, i know, back to the future ii was too complex), the slapstick of who framed roger rabbit?, and the action of flight and the walk. it’s also got the manic energy of i wanna hold your hand and spielberg’s 1941, both of which i enjoy but are not for everyone.used cars\\u200a—\\u200ai like it, you might, too.bayer watches: i recognized two actor’s names in the opening credits (russell and warden). that’s it. normally, with a film from 1980, i hope for more surprises. thankfully, used cars delivers with a ton of familiar faces. if you don’t know these names, you know a performance… al lewis, alfonso arau, frank mcrae, marc mcclure, michael talbott, joe flaherty, wendie jo sperber, david l. lander, and michael mckean. those last guys are lenny and squiggy. part of me wants to stop everything and figure out how these two decided to be in this movie, while also appearing together in laverne & shirley, and part of me realizes i’m dating myself for 80 percent of my audience. more important than that, this is zemeckis. this is spielberg (executive producer). thanks to rob hunter’s film school rejects article “34 things we learned from the used cars commentary” i just found out spielberg brainstormed this plot, but wanted george hamilton instead of russell. this is hilarious because i can’t imagine anyone besides russell pulling off this charm (plus, hamilton?!?). benson, you’re right. it shouldn’t be possible. a used car salesman/wannabe senator is not someone we consider caring about. i’d argue the script for used cars even agrees with that. but russell had other plans. case in point, as you mentioned warden plays brothers. well, the nice one dies from a heart attack. it’s something comedies used to do. they’d kill. 1974’s the longest yard did it as well. so let’s just decide n=2 and it happened all of the time. i was worried when i saw this scene coming, but two things made it worth while. russell fully, truly commits to the scene. in fact, he’s the only one acting like he’s in an intense drama (for this scene), while everyone else is trying to find a laugh. warden finds the perfect one. while fighting for life, he happily makes a sale. it’s truly brilliant. not only that, i found that it was my moment of giving myself over to this comedy and having a really good time. if warden doesn’t make the cash grab, i don’t accept this silly world. instead, i’m in.that doesn’t mean the movie is perfect. benson, when you say the movie is “raunchy as hell,” i assume you mean, “it objectifies women like almost every other film, especially those in the ’80s that were rated r.” women exist in this world to accidentally get naked, felt up, sexually assaulted, or rescued. wait, there is one who is simply a nervous teenage driver. women! it’s an indicator that bob gale and zemeckis didn’t know how or didn’t care to write a quality female character. it’s obvious, but by no means is it a deal breaker for me with the film. it’s like your racist grandmother. easy to spot, typical for the time, and impossible to change.eventually, a plot emerges. oddly, it hinges on telling the truth (in a court room) that this used car lot technically has a mile of cars to sell. it feels weird, mainly because we never assume commercials are telling you the truth.the problem with the film flow comes when rudy and barbara (deborah harmon) spend time developing a relationship. once it starts, the fun comes to a screeching halt. there are many varieties of the line, “i got something i need to get off my chest,” but the truth never comes out. laughs don’t seem like the top priority anymore. since this world is fairly over-the-top and fictitious, you’re just left waiting. but don’t worry. action is coming. the ending is truly enjoyable. there’s a huge caravan of cars (having to do with a mile of cars). with it comes some high-quality action featuring russell and his stunt double. benson, i like it.here are a bunch of tiny moments and some questions for you to consider…how many times have you seen this film? what was your first or most memorable viewing of the movie? is the homemade pacemaker your favorite surprise in the film? it’s mine. the sidekick jeff (gerrit graham) is great, which makes me slightly sad because while he’s a working actor, he didn’t become famous. anyway, when he does his thing in the bar about luck, and spills salt, crawls under a ladder, and breaks a mirror, it feels like that could easily be borrowed into it’s own film. i love the concept of luck and the lengths that people are willing to go when they believe in it.just recently, i’ve become addicted to film fridges thanks to the perfect one in empire of the sun. rudy’s refrigerator contains a jar of pickles, coors (heavy), a safe, and a ton of celery stalks. while empire offers the best, this is now the weirdest (until someone proves me otherwise). just to make sure we understand, it’s due to the insane amount of celery, not the safe.russell disco dancing should be a gif. i wouldn’t use it, because technology frightens me, but seeing him fully commit to dancing, while thinking about his brilliant character john ruth (from the hateful eight) is the history of an actor that i just love knowing.because i’m evil/awful/annoying you have to cast the remake. there is a figurative gun to your head. who are in the main leads? the audition scene for rudy would definitely be the fast-talking used car salesman scene that russell nails in the beginning of the film. my only change, i want middle school kids to somehow have to drive all of the cars at the end of the film.finally, i’d be remiss not to mention there is a title song at the end of the film. i want all movies, but specifically comedies, to be required by movie law to roll credits with a title theme song.movie score: 7/10benson responds: lenny and squiggy also appeared together in 1941 (the movie, not the year). i think maybe spielberg was high on george hamilton around that time because love at first bite was a hit and hamilton was pretty funny in it. would’ve made used cars a much different, not to mention sleazier, experience with him in the role instead of russell. and if hamilton had done used cars we may have never gotten zorro, the gay blade. bayer, would you want to live in that world?i think the longest yard is more drama than comedy. the burt reynolds one, i mean. but bonus points to you, bayer, for mentioning a prison movie while talking about jack warden.yeah, dude, women do not fare well in used cars. the film would get an f- on the bechdel test. but at least one could argue that the nudity is there specifically as exploitation. sex sells, and the characters in the film figure out that boobs and bad words are an excellent way to get people to the lot.you attribute the underwritten roles for women in this film to the youth of the writers, but has there ever been a fleshed-out and interesting part for a woman in a zemeckis movie? jessica rabbit? lea thompson in back to the future? oh, wait, i just remembered: angelina jolie in beowulf! anyway, creating great roles for the ladies has never been in his wheelhouse. but what he and bob gale were great at was twisty plots and exciting set pieces. the bad luck scene in used cars with the ladders and umbrellas is brilliant.i’ve probably seen used cars a couple dozen times, and have always been a little dismayed that it wasn’t a very popular film. i meet people all the time who love it, though, and a couple years ago i saw a screening of it in a packed theater that was laughing throughout. the biggest surprise in used cars for me, and part of the reason i think the movie holds up, is how vicious it gets, both in the killing of one fuchs brother, and the fight between rudy and the other fuchs (wielding a chain) in the back of a pick-up truck. it’s like a fast and furious movie with jokes. or intentional jokes, i should say.a remake of used cars, you say? i’m completely against it. but since there’s a gun pointed at me, i’d say chris pratt could do a pretty good job in the role of rudy. in fact, the rest of the characters could be played by the cast of parks and recreation. would love to see nick offerman in the dual role, aziz ansari could be the super superstitious guy, and amy poehler (or aubrey plaza) could add some comedic dimensions and personality to the female lead.and yes, used cars has a fantastic song at the end. reminds me of “eastbound and down” from smokey and the bandit. do movie themes get any better than that one?bayer concludes: lenny and squiggy\\xa0… that’s right. i forgot about 1941, which is definitely ready for me to watch again. it’s been years. i only remember liking, not loving, the film, and wondering why most considered it bad.zemeckis could point to kathleen turner in romancing the stone and jodie foster in contact, but i think everyone would give the actresses credit over zemeckis’ lead. you’re right. he, like almost all directors, isn’t great creating meaningful female characters.i’m a big fan of the parks and recreation crew reuniting for a film. yes, it should definitely be this one. offerman would clearly have a mustache for one brother. perhaps poehler can direct the film, if she wants to, and we’ll have pratt and plaza recreate some chemistry. poehler and rashida jones can be lenny and squiggy. adam scott can play joe flaherty’s character. nice job on the recasting benson, and sorry i had to use an imaginary gun to get you to do it, but it had to be done.also, i forgot to mention, jim’s (frank mcrae) punch through the windshield is amazing, and most importantly, necessary for the moment. it could be felt. this should be mimicked more. in fact, john wick 2, if you’re listening, borrow it.file this under, “times are changing,” when rudy has the promotion with the strippers. he is later shocked and bothered that someone actually got video of the thing. it made me realize we, and most definitely our children completely are without the concept of, “i did a public thing, but i assume no video was taken.” we truly are our own big brother, which is probably the most important lesson that used cars teaches us. that and russell is brilliant at any age, and boobs sell. one final question, do i really have to watch zorro, the gay blade?your next assignment: guest critic sam fragoso (host of talk easy, founder of movie mezzanine) selected sweet smell of success. it is available to rent on amazon, and itunes. your due date is thursday, may 26.',\n",

       " 'whatever happens, the landscape of hollywood animation will change because for the first time in about 30 years, katzenberg will not be a part of it. nbcu was willing to pay a premium for dwa in exchange for getting katzenberg to give up his role and transition to running digital assets such as the dwa-backed awesomenesstv. \"my guess is [nbcu] looked at jeffrey as someone who was not capable of or not willing to cut productions aggressively,\" says hulett. \"they figured meledandri knows how to do it. he\\'s delivering billion-dollar movies on $80 million budgets.\" hulett predicts nbcu will try to get dwa\\'s film budgets of $130 million or more down to less than $100 million. (hulett and others note the true cost of these movies is difficult to discern from the outside.)it is now part of hollywood lore how michael eisner and frank wells, on arriving at disney in 1984, were dismissive of animation and planning to outsource it cheaply overseas, only to be stopped by roy disney, walt\\'s nephew. tasked with it, katzenberg\\xa0became enamored and launched a string of hits beginning with the little mermaid and culminating, before his dismissal from disney in 1994, with the outsized success of the lion king. says hulett, \"he really revived animated features as an art form to the way they were thought of under disney in the \\'30s and \\'40s.\"when katzenberg founded dreamworks skg with steven spielberg and david geffen in 1994, \"there was a tremendous energy and drive to create a studio that would rival disney,\" says vicky jenson, a director of shrek and shark tale. in those days, dreamworks animators traveled abroad to study the settings of the films. and experts were brought in to educate them about the world in which they were working. that practice, still in place at pixar and its sister company disney animation studios, began to fade as dwa hit rough waters and layoffs ensued. katzenberg\\'s challenges were great after his division was spun off as a public company in 2004 to enable dreamworks to repay investor paul allen: dwa now was answering to shareholders, with fortunes that seesawed depending on its releases.katzenberg\\'s efforts to diversify dwa\\'s business led to distractions, and the quality of the films slipped. in recent years, \"one of the keywords presented to us was \\'marketability,\\' \" remembers jenson. \"business-wise, it probably made sense, but you could see the scary handwriting on the wall.\" she believes creative risk can be discouraged when marketers lead: \"if pixar had done that, i don\\'t think we would have seen the movie up.\"disney\\'s handling of pixar and disney animation, which were both placed under pixar co-founders john lasseter and ed catmull\\xa0after the 2006 purchase, clearly is the goal of nbcu\\'s\\xa0dwa purchase. lasseter has managed to revive the fortunes of disney animation with such hits as frozen and the recent zootopia while maintaining the quality and bankability of pixar films (despite the recent disappointment the good dinosaur). at the same time, pixar has remained based in northern california, operating with a distinct culture and a creative mandate separate from its southern california sibling disney animation.\\xa0\\xa0',\n",

       " \"        a palme d'or winner for 'the wind that shakes the barley,' ken loach returns to cannes with this drama about two honest people caught in an uncaring welfare system.    \",\n",
       " \"for more than 50 years, ken loach has been making social-realist dramas tied together by a prevailing thread — the compassionate observation of the struggles of the working class to hold onto such fundamental dignities as a home, a job and food on the table within a hostile system that often views them unfairly as the cause of their own misfortunes. his latest feature, i, daniel blake, is quintessential loach, which means you have a good idea of what you're getting as soon as the core elements are established. and yet while the framework and perspective are familiar, the veteran brit director's films can still have the power to grip us in an emotional chokehold.that's very much the case in loach's latest cannes competition entry, despite a script by his longtime collaborator paul laverty that at times wades into didactic pandering, hammering home in dialogue points about a callous state that are already embedded in the story. the tendency to pile indignation upon indignation almost risks nudging the drama onto a righteous soapbox.but despite those flaws, the film is anchored by incisive characterizations rich in integrity and heart, and by an urgent simplicity in its storytelling that's surprisingly powerful. this is reflected also in cinematographer robbie ryan's crisp, unfussy presentation of the newcastle upon tyne setting. eschewing handwringing, i, daniel blake portrays ordinary people pushed to breaking point by circumstances beyond their control, and by a government welfare system of circuitous kafkaesque bureaucracy seemingly designed to beat them down.at the center is the geordie of the title, daniel blake, played by comedian dave johns in a performance all the more moving for its restraint, and for the dogged determination etched deeper into his face with each fresh frustration. a skilled carpenter in his late fifties, daniel lives alone in a brutalist low-cost housing block, keeping up a scrappy but good-natured rapport with his neighbors. he has managed to remain gainfully employed even while nursing his wife through a long illness that ultimately killed her. but doctors have forbidden him from returning to work until he has sufficiently recovered from a heart attack.the beginning of his odyssey is amusingly played out in offscreen dialogue heard over the opening titles, as a health officer interviews daniel about his eligibility for employment and support allowance. his impatience grows as he fields a string of inane questions about basic motor skills and continence, none of them having anything to do with the condition of his heart. when the assessor judges him fit for work, his travails begin, first on a telephone helpline with epic hold time, and then at the local job center, where getting someone actually to listen while he explains his situation proves impossible.\",\n",
       " 'loach and laverty make the argument that the arcane complexities of the welfare system — with its head-spinning protocols, appeals, sanctions and built-in stumbling blocks — are a political weapon designed to save the government money. while that institutional hostility is represented here by the cold indifference of employment office workers, it\\'s clear that the filmmakers are taking issue with the kind of unfounded generalizations common to conservative pundits, who accuse people on welfare of being lazy \"skivers\" that don\\'t want to work.the one sympathetic ear at the job center belongs to a woman named ann (kate rutter), who is reprimanded by her supervisor for taking the time to walk befuddled daniel through a confusing online form. she warns him that not following the rules can have dire consequences, and that many honest, hardworking people like him have found themselves on the street after being defeated by the system. the story essentially boils down to daniel\\'s quest to hang in there and play the game long enough to secure an appeal interview — all while continuing to live without an income.he hits frequent brick walls, but daniel also experiences many small acts of kindness from people in a vividly drawn milieu that loach clearly knows well. and daniel in turn shows overwhelming kindness to katie (hayley squires), a young single mother with two children, relocated from london after being evicted by her affordable-housing landlord for filing a legitimate complaint, and then spending two years in a homeless hostel. beaten by her own clashes with the job center, katie goes without food and basic necessities to take care of her kids, eventually pushing her to make heartbreaking choices.anyone who has ever witnessed an elderly parent or relative struggle with automated customer support lines or basic computer functions will find it distressing to watch daniel\\'s exasperation. the film provides cogent evidence that we no longer live in a society designed to listen to people\\'s problems, and many are simply unable to navigate the modern world unassisted.the basic human rights at stake here are tremendously relatable, even to those of us who have never come close to this degree of deprivation. one of the more upsetting scenes shows katie\\'s visit to a food bank, where her near-starvation causes an incident that alarms her children and daniel, who has grown close to the family. like johns, who embraces the story\\'s farcical elements while never obscuring its sorrow, squires strikes no false notes in her beautifully subdued performance. if the script veers into cliché by backing katie into the most compromising corner of hopelessness, the character never seems less than authentic.it\\'s too easy to be cynical about loach\\'s films, and his inclusion in the cannes lineup often prompts eye rolls about good old stalwart leftie ken, back with another noble anti-conservative tract. but the consistency of his career and the clarity of his message command admiration. this film contains echoes of any number of previous entries from the director\\'s extensive output, stretching back to cathy come home, the searing 1966 bbc tv play about homelessness. but it also feels entirely of the moment in a time of increasing attention to income inequality as the divide between the haves and have-nots becomes a dangerous chasm.venue: cannes film festival (competition)\\tcast: dave johns, hayley squires, dylan mckiernan, briana shann, kate rutter, sharon percy, kema sikazwe\\tproduction companies: sixteen films, why not productions, wild bunch, les films du fleuve, le pacte\\tdirector: ken loach\\tscreenwriter: paul laverty\\tproducer: rebecca o’brien\\texecutive producers: pascal caucheteux, gregoire sorlat, vincent maraval\\tdirector of photography: robbie ryan\\tproduction designers: fergus clegg, linda wilson\\tcostume designer: joanne slater\\tmusic: george fenton\\teditor: jonathan morris\\tcasting: kahleen crawford\\tsales: wild bunch\\tno rating, 100 minutes.',\n",

       " 'nestled down a sleepy street in the historic rattanakosin district of bangkok, thailand, the nang loeng cinema was built in 1918 by the siam cinema co. the theater closed its doors in 1993â\\x8d, around the time that shopping malls and modern multiplexes were popping up across thailand, driving the country’s quaint single-screen neighborhood cinemas out of business. the â\\x82â\\x83â\\x83400-seat antique movie house is made entirely of thai teak, except for its original galvanized iron roof. for years, the nang loeng cinema was used as a warehouse for a nearby open-air market.now, a group of conservationists, film lovers and the property bureau of the thai monarchy have come together to revive the theater, which organizers hope will be back in service by 2018, in time to celebrate the structure’s centenary. the conservation effort was kick-started by philip jablon, an american photographer and sustainable development researcher who has been chronicling the state of southeast asia’s heritage cinemas for the last six years via an undertaking he calls the southeast asia movie theater project. with modest financial support from the thai film archive, jablon has been traveling across thailand, myanmar, vietnam, cambodia and laos, photographing and cataloging an estimated 300 cinemas.',\n",
       " '',\n",
       " '“old movie theaters tend to be the first thing to go during development,” says jablon, “because they have a large footprint and usually occupy prime real estate.” the same forces of economic development that are raising living standards and making southeast asia a bright spot on the global movie distribution map also carry a bitter irony for the region’s cinematic heritage. jablon says he has returned to many towns and cities in myanmar and thailand to find beautiful midcentury movie theaters already replaced by box stores or shopping centers.jablon’s goal was to create an archive of the region’s cinematic architecture before it disappeared. “but the hope was always that the project could help foster some conservation efforts,” he adds. his belief is that once the boom era subsides, southeast asian cities will go through the same process of urban rediscovery western cities have, turning away from suburban sprawl to revive heritage architecture in city centers.to his delight, the past year has brought positive momentum. “there’s been a sea change in the way people are looking at architectural preservation in thailand,” says jablon. along with nang loeng cinema, the prince cinema in one of bangkok’s riverside districts has been targeted for revival by a city government project. built in the ’30s, the theater has fallen into disrepair and operated as a porn theater in its final years.',\n",

       " 'cannes 2016. maren ade\\'s \"toni erdmann\"the german director’s long-anticipated third film is a triumph of observational storytelling.yesterday, many of our hopes were realized at the cannes film festival. german director maren ade, whose second film everyone else still feels like the secret discovery of 2008, has finally returned with a new film—and it is not only great, it\\'s a also quite a surprise. devoted with extreme sensitivity and patience to the stilted relationship between a professional young woman, sandra hüller\\'s uptight, defensive ines, and her sad sack, prankster father winfried (peter simonischek), toni erdmann spends its considerable runtime observing how these two, by themselves and together, put up emotional shields to navigate unhappy lives.on paper perhaps something of a cliché, with ines’ repressed chill keeping her career successful, if just barely, but emotionally unsatisfied working a corporate consultancy job in bucharest, and a father whose sudden appearance at her work is an awkward embarrassment. yet this immensely talented director brings to each and every social interaction an observant, unmannered, and utterly spot-on evocation of what each person is thinking and feeling. this masterly ability to observe and reveal without overly directing our attention to what the father and daughter are going through extends just as beautifully to well-detailed secondary roles like that of ines\\' arrogant boss, her frightened-eyed assistant, and an american girlfriend also living in the romanian capital—a deft handling that goes all the way down to passing characters spied once and never again. maren ade proves herself a modest master of observation, letting us find on our own, casually and never didactically, how everyone in a scene is responding to each other and the circumstance.toni erdmann’s precision of observation may make it sound like a normal drama done well, but in fact ade keeps us on our toes throughout its near-3 hours run time. the film rides an at first unnoticeable but gradually increasingly apparent and difficult line of storytelling, courting our expectations of how a father-daughter story like this will go—with her embarrassment over her father’s antics and unprofessionalism coupled with his sweetly clueless, silent pleas for affection—but at every turn upending convention. except, ade does nothing radical, nothing unusual as her story moves, it simply moves freely, each development not quite how one would think it could go, yet never extreme enough to move into melodrama or some other extreme that would leave the film’s calm, considerate humaneness behind.its attention, through and through, are to the nuances of a deeply unresolved relationship, one which a father’s impromptu sudden visit will hardly instantly fix. but the man is persistent and dogged, playing constantly with fake teeth and sarcastic humor with a barely hidden grin. he kindly tries, without much self-awareness, to ingratiate himself in situations, whether at a corporate party or in the strained, everyday conversations with his daughter, in which he is uncomfortable and doesn\\'t fit in—which are most situations. he leaves, he returns, she sends him away, and he comes back, always with the sheepish, smiling look on his face. the film is, gratefully and painfully, very funny and very sad.winfried is trying and we like him for this, but we also don\\'t know the full history of his uncomfortable relationship with his daughter—we simply feel it, deeply, just as we do ines\\' depression and self-denial. midway through, faced again with his daughter’s rejection, winfried makes one of his goofy gestures of ill-placed humor, hilariously popping up at a bar behind his daughter in a ridiculous wig, the bad teeth, and an unkempt power suit and claims to be\\xa0“toni erdmann,” a life coach visiting bucharest. even worse, this character starts showing up at his daughter’s social engagements and work—work, incidentally, that ade treats with remarkable detail and realism, as we learn just what exactly ines has to do and what she has to put up with at her awful consultancy job.in another film, winfried\\'s almost farcical costume would transform the story into something else, as his daughter learns what lengths he’ll go to be with her. but no—it’s just another, more elaborate joke that’s trying to win a smile on her face, with no greater ambitions. to close her story, ade admittedly have to bring things to a head, a birthday party the daughter pathetically throws for herself which doesn’t turn out a she plans, yet as always with the film, the way the situation shifts, catches us off guard, ending somewhere far different than where it began. the party, a constantly evolving situation of great humor and insight, does precisely what maren ade throughout does best and what makes toni erdmann great: never grasping for epiphanies but instead building over time, with warm patience and true perception, an incredibly rich portrait of people and their all-too-delicate relationships.',\n",

       " 'it’s not often that i get invited down to industrial light & magic in san francisco, ca, but when the invite is thrown my way it’s usually to see something cool. earlier this month i traveled up north to see how filmmaker duncan jones used ilm to create the orcs in his big screen adaptation warcraft, based on the popular blizzard video game series.i’ll be completely honest with you: the marketing for this movie had done little to convince me that it was a film i wanted to see. i’m not a video gamer and have never played world of warcraft, and to be completely honest, i’m not a big fantasy (orcs, wizards, dungeons and dragons) type of guy. but i’m a big fan of duncan jones and that alone had me continuously searching for reasons.so i hopped on a plane and visited the visual effects house that george lucas built, hoping i would\\xa0be wowed.\\xa0the filmmakers behind the movie pulled the curtain back to show us how the magic was created, and that in itself was not only very interesting but very impressive. so hit the jump and learn why ilm considers the warcraft facial capture advancements to be groundbreaking. the huge challenge of creating realistic-looking orcsduncan jones knew that when he came on to warcraft that the biggest challenge would be creating the orcs themselves. he explained to me that they needed to have characters that not only could win the audience’s empathy, but\\xa0could “hold a close-up.”a lot of the design choices in the video game were made over twenty years ago. ilm realized they needed to adapt the more cartoony look of the designs to fit the mandate of presenting what those characters and species would look like if they were real. wei wang, a blizzard concept artist, gave them an initial sketch which became the blueprint on how the orcs should look. and you could easily mistake this initial sketch as art inspired by the movie\\xa0—\\xa0it looks that close to what we see in the film.in the world of warcraft, orcs have the same size heads as humans but are much wider and stand 6 and a half to 7 feet tall. the artists\\xa0decided that practical make-up wouldn’t work for what they needed, so they instead decided to go all in on a performance and facial capture approach.by creating the orcs using performance capture, they didn’t have to worry about how big, tall, or muscular the actors were, instead focusing purely on performance. the orcs’ movements were developed by terry notary, who of course also\\xa0worked on the lord of the rings films and the apes films. terry notary played a lot of the “background” characters in the film, as well as some of the hero characters, notably grommash hellscream. ilm’s “groundbreaking” facial capture work on warcraftilm had been working on their facial capture technology for a while now and felt they were finally making impressive headway with the work they did on the hulk in the avengers. ilm completed some tests to help convince jones that the technology was at the stage it needed to be to accomplish his vision for warcraft, but it wasn’t until he got back the first completed shot that he was convinced that his bet would pay off. that first shot is one of the most impressive shots in the entire movie, and you’ll see it very early in the film. it’s not a big impressive battle, but a very emotional scene between an orc and his pregnant wife in their hut.the emotion that comes from the faces of these computer generated creatures is astounding and it’s no surprise that ilm considers their facial capture work on this film to be “groundbreaking.” we’re seen some impressive facial capture work from weta, especially on the recent apes films, and while andy serkis has been fighting the battle of what he calls “digital make-up,” performances still require animators to rework and manipulate the data captured on set. but this film supposedly features a closer to one-to-one ratio of performance to rendering.we were shown a very impressive video showing a side-by-side comparison of the human motion capture performances and the final renders, and i know we’ve seen this sort of thing before on avatar and the apes films, but this was even more impressive — it’s amazing how much of the facial movements of the human actors made it to the cg versions of the orcs. you can see a short snippet of some of the footage i screened in this new featurette:videothe facial motion capture was not approached as something expendable or something to be used as merely reference, but as\\xa0performances that needed to be captured for the final product. ilm is particularly proud that very little modification was taken to create the completed facial performances in the film. the facial capture was accomplished with two cameras on the face of each hero orc actor, with over 200 motion dots on the face which needed to be tracked. people, assisted with some software tools, have to individually guide the tracking of every dot. they also did a rigid track on the eyeballs and teeth, allowing them to separate out the jaw motion from the skin/head.once they had all this data, the ilm animators would reproduce the performance on a 3d scan of the actor to make sure it looked right before they even began to transfer the performances to the model of their orc counterpart.',\n",

       " 'spaghetti pie with pecorino and black pepperadapted from justin chapple at food & winethis pie plays off the flavors of classic cacio e pepe — these flavors will be, delightfully, the strongest — but, of course, i fiddled with it a little. the first time, i made it with 8 ounces each of pecorino romano and fontina (because although i love cheddar, i just couldn’t). the second time, i made with less of each (which was a mistake) and because i’ve become that person, the kind of person that needs to see some green before i can allow something to become a regular meal, i added about a cup of blanched and finely chopped broccoli rabe (which was not). that said, while we enjoyed our green-flecked spaghetti wedges, we agreed we’d have liked it just as much with the greens on the side, preferably in a garlicky and pepper flake sauteed heap. a few important cooking notes: you must wrap your springform tightly in foil or you and your oven floor will end up in a very bad mood. please (i beg here) cook your pasta until it’s a good two minutes from done as it will continue cooking in the oven and mushy pasta makes me sad. the greens here are optional (see above) but keep in mind that if you add them, you’ll want to do your best to remove every extra drop of moisture and anticipate that it will take longer to set. finally, to me, good aged pecorino (usually sold with a black rind) makes all the difference here in providing a salty, funky kick. you can use parmesan if it’s all you’ve got, but you might find that you need more salt if you do.\\u2003butter for greasing springform1/2 pound broccoli rabe, toughest stems saved for another use, chopped into few-inch segments (optional)1 pound dried spaghetti1 1/2 cups milk3 large eggs, lightly beaten2 to 3 teaspoons ground black pepper2 teaspoons coarse or kosher salt8 ounces aged pecorino cheese, finely grated, divided8 ounces fontina cheese, grated, dividedheat oven to 425 degrees. butter a 9-inch springform pan and this is very important, wrap the outside of the springform, focusing on the places where the ring meets the base, tightly in aluminum foil. set aside.bring a large pot of well-salted water to a boil. if using broccoli rabe, add it to the pot and boil for 1 to 2 minutes, until it has some give. fish it out with a large slotted spoon and drain it well. set aside.add spaghetti to boiling water and cook until (this is also important) 2 minutes shy of done, so very al dente, as the spaghetti will continue cooking in the oven. drain well and let cool slightly.if using broccoli rabe, wring all extra moisture out of it and blot greens on paper towels to be extra careful. mince rabe into very small bits. you’ll have about 1 cup total.in a large bowl, whisk eggs and milk together with salt and pepper. stir in all but 1/2 cup of each cheese and chopped rabe, if using. add spaghetti and toss to coat. pour into prepared springform and sprinkle remaining cheese on top. bake for 35 to 40 minutes (without greens) and up to 15 minutes more (with greens, as they add moisture too), until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the pie and turned slightly will not release any loose egg batter into the center. if the top of your pie browns too quickly before the center is set, cover it with foil for the remaining cooking time.turn on your oven’s broiler. broil the pie a few inches from the heat for 2 to 3 minutes, until browned on top. cut along springform ring to loosen, then remove ring. run a spatula underneath the pie to loosen the base and slide onto a serving plate. cut into wedges.see more: casserole, italian, pasta, photo, vegetarian, winter do more: link | bookmark  | pin | print | email | 136 comments',\n",
